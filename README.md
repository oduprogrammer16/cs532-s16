# Course Work for CS432 Introduction to Web Science (Spring 2016)

## Comments

This course was not easy. I was taking 18-credits or 6 classes during the semester and managing the heavy load required every ounce of strength I had. My grades got off to a rough start but I managed to pull the grades up. I ended up earning a 76-C for the class. Had I not been sick during Assignment 2, I would have probably recieved a solid B for the course. 

This set of assignments is used to show my persistancy. I refuse to give up without a fight.
