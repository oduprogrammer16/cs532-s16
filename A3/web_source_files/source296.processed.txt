The Detox Kitchen's Healthy Blueberry Pancake Recipe

     * 22 July 2015

   LILY SIMPSON, founder of The Detox Kitchen, shares her perfect recipe
   for a healthy breakfast - blueberry pancakes, coconut yoghurt and a
   raspberry smoothie.

Blueberry and cinnamon pancakes with fresh peach and coconut yoghurt

     * 2 eggs
     * 100g gluten and wheat free flour
     * ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
     * Pinch of cinnamon
     * 100ml rice milk
     * 1 vanilla pod
     * 100g blueberries, extra to garnish
     * 1 peach, sliced to garnish
     * 2 tbsp coconut yogurt

   Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl and whisk. Then sieve in the flour,
   bicarbonate of soda and cinnamon and combine with a wooden spoon to
   make a thick paste. Gradually add in the milk to make a smooth batter.
   Slice the vanilla pod in half and scrap out the seeds, then add them to
   the mixture and combine well.

   Now squeeze the blueberries with your fingers and mix them into the
   batter.

   Place a non-stick frying pan on a high heat and add a few drops of
   coconut oil. Using a ladle, gently spoon a quarter of the mixture onto
   the center of the pan and cook for 1-2 minutes until golden, then flip
   over and cook for a further 1-2 minutes. Remove from the heat and
   repeat with the rest of the mixture.

   Once all the pancakes are cooked serve two on each plate and garnish
   with some fresh peach, blueberries and a dollop of coconut yogurt.

Raspberry, banana and coconut smoothie

     * 100g raspberries
     * 1 banana
     * 2 tbsp coconut yogurt
     * 200ml mineral water
     * A few ice cubes

   Place all the ingredients in a blender or Nutribullet and blitz until
   smooth.

   Nichols and on London's Kingly Street - for more information, visit
