[12]Masks, Miscues, & Mayhem

   [13]smoakandarrow:

     Whew.  Did I start a kerfuffle the other day or what?  As I
     mentioned on Twitter, that format isn’t the best to clear up
     miscommunications or misunderstandings.  Blogs are.  So here we go.

     It all started with DC’s tweet about their All Access interview with
     Emily Bett
     image

     and my response:
     image

     To save people the chore of tagging [14]@marcguggenheim on this post
     or selectively screencapping it for him.  There.  Tagged him.
     Figured it was just easier this way, Marc.  I’m nothing if not
     transparent.  Whatever I say on any of my social media accounts I
     would gladly say face to face for discussion.  I’m all about
     discussion.  Good?  Good.

     For the purposes of this post, “mask” refers to a hero suit, mask,
     or combo of both.  It’s just a lazy shortcut for me cause I don’t
     want to keep having to type mask and/or suit.

     Oh, one more thing: I have never, ever, said I speak for anyone, let
     alone the fandom. Ever.  I speak for myself.  Period.  My opinions
     and the things I say are mine.  This is why I encourage everyone to
     be vocal for themselves.  Is everyone going to always agree on
     things?  Of course not.  That’s why it’s called opinion.
       _______________________________________________________________

     Now, before we get into what I was driving at in my tweet, let’s be
     super clear about what I was not saying.

I was absolutely NOT saying:

     1. Felicity Smoak is not a hero if she doesn’t have a mask!

     2. Felicity Smoak won’t be recognized by others as a hero until she
     has a mask… so give her a mask!

     3. I want/need/crave Felicity Smoak as a masked hero. It must
     happen!  It must!!! {hurls self on ground sobbing over her lack of
     maskdom}

     4. I want Felicity Smoak to get a mask just so she can be in
     posters, ads, and other promotion
       _______________________________________________________________

     I think that’s clear enough.  Everybody gets what I was not saying,
     right?  Cool.  So set all those out of our brains for the rest of
     this discussion.  This is a conversation – with questions – about a
     topic that’s popped up repeatedly through the seasons.  All I’m
     doing is phrasing & presenting it a different way and I think that’s
     where the short-circuiting began.

     Some of these questions were asked when CW released this promo:

     IFRAME:
     [15]https://www.youtube.com/embed/p1P7ujKw9yQ?feature=oembed&enablej
     sapi=1&origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&wmode=opaque

     They were asked when CW had this Heroes/Villains panel and
     [16]looked like this.  And yes, David Ramsey was there, but he also
     teased discussion of Diggle getting some sort of suit.

     They were asked again when this printed promotional material came
     out and popped up at cons and other promotional opportunities.
     image

     That question was: Why, if the CW Network and the Arrow show runners
     say, “You don’t need a mask to be a hero,” are the only people
     marketed/promoted as heroes by CW the ones in masks?

     Keep this question in mind.  Also keep in mind that Arrow show
     runners don’t control network promotion.

     The other day, Marc graciously answered an Ask I sent him.
     image

     I think I’m pretty clear in my ask, right?  I’m following up a point
     DC Comics itself raised in their interview with Emily.  I’m
     philosophically musing the issue of “Why not Felicity Smoak?” and I
     wanted to know his thoughts on Pros & Cons of suiting her up.  I
     think Marc is very clear in agreeing 100% that a hero does not need
     a mask and that Felicity Smoak IS a hero.  I think we all agree,
     right?  Right.

     Am I outraged over no suits/mask for Felicity?  Pfft. Absolutely
     not. {points to #1-4 above}.  I don’t even care if she gets a mask
     for crying out loud. The mask is not  the point.  This is not a
     rant.  I am not angry.  What I am is trying to open a dialogue and
     discussion about Felicity Smoak because I’m curious.  When I want to
     know something: I ask.

     Now, bring all this together with my response to DC Comics’ tweet
     and when apparently everything hit the fan in a jumble of Wha?

What HAVE I been Saying / Asking

     My question is simple.  Why Not Felicity?  Why?  Why, from a show
     structure stance, not Felicity Smoak?  This “Why Not“ question is
     not about the mask.  It’s about the entire landscape and philosophy
     behind the choices with this particular character by the show &
     network vs. other characters.

     I ask Why Not Felicity? not because she “has to have” a mask but
     because - in a comic book based show - where everyone (okay,
     exception of Quentin noted)… everyone has become a masked hero… Why
     not Felicity?  Why is she where the “Never!” line is apparently
     drawn? Why is the answer, for her, a “it will probably be after I
     leave the show” when practically every other question, idea,  and
     proposition for other characters is almost always answered with,
     “Never say Never” and “it will happen if we can find an organic way
     to go there”?  Hell, even the No Goatee stance has recently been
     abandoned.

     So… Why not Felicity?

     Look, I love Felicity Smoak.  I adore her.  I love her for who she
     is on every level.  I also love her stunts.  I love her undercover
     missions.  I love when she gets to go into the field to help blow up
     buildings, take down a master jewel thief, thwart Slade Wilson, and
     jump out of airplanes.  Remember all that?  Of course you do.  It
     was fun stuff!

     Season 3 didn’t give her any of that.  Dark days.  Boo.

     Now, in Season 4, she’s paralyzed and obviously won’t be doing any
     of that stuff for awhile, if ever (cue dramatic music).  Could this
     still be great story for her?  Of course!  It’s why I’m waiting to
     see how it all plays out.  There’s great setup with her dad and so
     many things.  I’m a story whore.  Bring it.

     BUT.  This does not prevent me from asking questions now because,
     while the current situation obviously has great story implications,
     it also has deeper, ongoing issues that – while unpleasant – still
     have to be considered.

     Felicity designed tech.  But not anymore.  Cause people with
     masks/mask destinies get to do that now.

     Felicity reconstructed the lair multiple times.  But not anymore.
     Cause people with masks/mask destinies get to do that now. Yes, she
     “gave input” but still it was made clear: Mask.

     Felicity is tasked with saving her company.  But doesn’t.  Cause
     somebody with a mask destiny (no we haven’t seen said mask, but yes,
     they’ve made it clear it’s coming) got to do it.  But hey, Felicity
     got to give a Powerpoint presentation about the brilliance of masked
     & soon-to-be-masked people’s achievements and contributions.

     Felicity used to do stunts.  But doesn’t anymore.  Cause it’s not
     organic.  But… masks.

     Felicity used to go into the field.  But doesn’t anymore.  Cause
     it’s not organic.  But… masks.

     Felicity “used to” do a lot of things that are now “masked”
     assigned, organic for them, but not for her.  So no, Felicity Smoak
     does not need a mask, but the question must be asked: Does not
     having a mask mean she’s losing out on things bestowed upon those
     who are?

     Wait! I hear you in the back!

     “Felicity Smoak doesn’t need a mask!  She’s a hacker & doesn’t even
     go on missions.  She stays in the lair and nobody sees her!”

     Yes.  Exactly.  Absorb that for a moment: Felicity Smoak never goes
     on missions anymore.

     Since when?

     Which brings us back around to this:
     image

     Again: pointing out that Felicity Smoak (maskless) rocks and is just
     as ass-kickery and awesome as Peggy (maskless) Carter.

     I totally get what Marc is saying here about a leap of faith putting
     people in masks.  Clearly they took that leap with Oliver.  And
     Diggle.  And Roy.  Thea. Sara.  Malcolm.  Nyssa.  Katana.  Slade.
     Isabel.  Brother Blood.  Etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.,
     etc.

     Cause the potential to feel silly is high.

     I totally get that.  I think we’ve all had that moment with the show
     at some point where we all kind of chuckle at the “silly”
     sometimes.  He’s right.

     So.  Moratorium on masks then for the future then?  Not so fast.
     Don’t forget Curtis. I like Curtis.  I’m cool with Curtis.  However,
     he’s also Mr. Terrific who, we’ve already been told, is destined for
     a mask too.  Curtis.  Who is already designing tech, saving the
     company, doing stunts, physically fighting (Cisco, too, btw, and
     nobody’s blinking at them doing it, but Felicity does it it’s
     outrageous?) and, has already been included on a field mission.

     Do you get WHY these questions are in my brain?  I don’t think
     they’re illogical.  I think some of them have popped into others
     brains at some point, too.  I’m just asking them all in one glut,
     with one simple question: Why not Felicity Smoak?

Why not?

     Because it’s not organic for her…but when a mask is involved, it is?

Am I asking them to slap Felicity in a mask to solve these issues?  No.
Again: This is not about wanting Felicity in a mask.  But if the CW & Arrow
show runners continue to say “Yes, Felicity Smoak is Hero! She doesn’t need a
mask to be a hero!” but turn around and keep her from doing these very things
because she lacks that mask, then is her heroism really being given the same
weight and empowerment as those who are masked?

     Again, I ask these things not as a rant.  I’m not angry.  I want to
     understand choices and vision and the plan.  I’m curious.  Just like
     I’m curious why Felicity hasn’t been trained in even the most basic
     form of self defense, why she hasn’t been given a voice about
     children, and if – when and if she gets use of her legs back –
     she’ll be allowed to train then.  ‘Cause that feels organic to me.
     It would, in fact, feel inorganic to do anything less.  And before
     you say it, “Yes, we saw one quick training scene back in season
     one!” not much has been done since to show her skills have continued
     to grow (not saying she’s not helpful in a fight).  I’m just asking:
     Why not Felicity?

     I’ve said all of this to Marc in previous messages.  Include this
     ask:
     image

     This whole topic also has nothing to do with it “being Oliver’s
     show” or “about him” either.  Yes, he is the lead, yes {{insert all
     the obvious disclaimers here}}} but this show is also about the huge
     group of supporting players all of whom have not been denied the
     same attention, growth, reactions, etc., etc., etc.  So why would
     Felicity be handled differently?

     Felicity has earned these rights.  IMO, she’s earned it as much (if
     not more) than some characters.  She has to be allowed to grow.  She
     cannot remain static “because it’s Felicity.”

     Is she even being handled differently?  Is it “perception”?  Maybe.

     Does any of this mean the current story for Felicity Smoak won’t be
     awesome?  Of course not!

     Does it mean that any of these choices in this story (paralysis,
     wheelchair, etc) were made for nefarious reasons?  Of course not!

     Does it mean I’m not excited for all the possibilities, her father,
     and what’s to come for Felicity Smoak or feel that Felicity Smoak
     isn’t freaking awesome?  Hell no.  I’m in my chair watching every
     week!  Let’s see where this roller coaster ride goes!

     However, this also does not mean that people with these questions –
     people like me – shouldn’t be asking Arrow TPTB about this stuff
     *NOW,* especially since the EPs have already said they’re talking
     Season 5 plans.

     If nobody asked these questions – if nobody ever says, “Hey, do you
     realize that (true or not) the perception for some of this stuff
     comes across as…” – until after Season 4 is over, it’s already way
     too late.

     “But Felicity doesn’t need to change!” people tell me.  “She’s
     perfect the way she is!”  Of course she doesn’t “need to change.”
     She is amazing.  But she does need to evolve as a character.  Every
     character does and has on Arrow.  Every single one of them.  They’ve
     been given that opportunity, whether you feel they earned that right
     or not.

     Felicity has made some changes, but there have been setbacks as
     well, perceived stripping of skill-sets that feel granted to other
     (masked/destined to be masked) people.

     Felicity Smoak cannot be the exception to the rules the network/show
     applies to everybody else.  That is all I have been trying to say.
     And if Felicity doesn’t get those opportunities, if she is denied
     everything else I’ve discussed above?  Say it with me:

Why Not Felicity Smoak?
