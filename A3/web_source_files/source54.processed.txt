The best and worst commercials from Super Bowl 50

   [19]Yardbarker Yardbarker 2016-02-08 Vincent Frank

   This is the first time in a while that we can come away from the Super
   Bowl without criticizing the commercials. That could have to do with
   the game itself being a snooze fest. It could also have to do with the
   fact that most of the commercials were actually pretty good.

   From an awesome Doritos ad focusing on an unborn child wanting to take
   a bite out of the chip to puppy monkey baby, there were some pretty
   good commercials during Super Bowl 50.

   On the other end of the spectrum, there were some feeble attempts at
   creativity. A specific add surrounding Heinz comes to mind first.

   Here are your best and worst commercials from Super Bowl 50.

   Talk about teaching your child early. The scene is a man and a pregnant
   woman in the hospital as she's going through one of those regular check
   ups.

   The man decides that bringing Doritos into the room with them made
   perfect sense. When he noticed the baby moving around in the woman's
   stomach in the direction of the chips, he decides to play a game —
   moving the chips in his hand as a way to force the baby into kicking.

   Fed up, the woman takes the chip and tosses it across the room. You can
   pretty much conclude what happened after without us telling you. Don't
   ever make a pregnant woman angry. That's rule No. 1, gents.

       Everyone loves the Super Bowl, but the next best thing about the
       big game is always the commercials. This year, during Super Bowl
       50, there will be ads featuring Ryan Reynolds, Seth Rogen, Amy
       Schumer and Alan Rickman, the beloved "Harry Potter" icon who
       passed away last month after a battle with cancer. Rickman's final
       film role is in the Disney sequel "Alice Through the Looking
       Glass," and his voice can be heard in the just-released Super Bowl
       commercial for the film as the Blue Caterpillar.

   Actor Willem Dafoe standing over a subway platform in a dress
   pretending he's the great Marilyn Monroe. He eats a Snickers, and the
   "real" Norma Jeane shows up.

   It might have been a bit corny, but we have to give Snickers some
   credit for originality here. The commercial was made when a gust of
   wind blew Dafoe's skirt up to expose his undergarments.

   For those with an understanding of film history, Monroe absolutely
   hated filming this specific scene for "The Seven Year Itch." That's
   what made the commercial. Well, outside of the fact that Dafoe made an
   utter fool of himself.

   Yes. Three awesome things combined. Mountain Dew hadn't done a Super
   Bowl commercial in nearly two decades. So when it decided to advertise
   the energy drink Kickstart, we pretty much knew the plan was going to
   be big.

   Speaking solely to an audience that have shown themselves to enjoy Jack
   in the Box commercials with marijuana overtones, Mountain Dew kicked
   this one out of the park.

   Who in their right mind would think of a puppy monkey baby combination?
   No one. That's kinda the point here, isn't it?

   So many sexual innuendos here. In case you didn't know, a marmot is a
   rodent that's seen here in North America. It's also not human. Just to
   clarify all of this weirdness for you.

   The commercial depicts a man and a marmot going on some sort of a
   bromance camping trip together. When the man gets the wrong idea and
   leans over to kiss the rodent, the furry creature simply responds, "I
   am not that kind of marmot."

   If nothing else, this put the clothing line on the national map. Prior
   to today's Super Bowl, this one scribe had never heard of the company
   before. That's the genius of advertising, as it will be on my mind from
   here on out.

   Best: Whitney Houston's "Independence Day" trailer

   Showing Houston's rendition of the National Anthem prior to Super Bowl
   XXV in 1991, this trailer for the sequel to the 1996 blockbuster hit
   got off to a rip-roaring start.

   The rest of the ad didn't disappoint, as generations of Whitney and
   "Independence Day" fans were teased with what should be a pretty darn
   amazing Hollywood spectacle this upcoming summer. Well played, indeed.

   Equating a car with landing on the moon. Doing so while portraying a
   former president that seems depressed after leaving office only to
   lighten up when his son takes him for a drive in an Audi.

   There is a certain level of ridiculous involved here. More than that,
   this commercial pretty much insulted the intelligence of every Super
   Bowl viewer. It was not creative, nor was it smart.

   It's the year 2016. Do we really care what color that dress was? One of
   the most important aspects of advertising is keeping up with the times.
   This advertisement failed in every possible way when it came to that
   aspect.

   Besides, Scott Baio shouldn't be on anything ever again. It doesn't
   matter if he didn't say a word. He was still there. That's a failure in
   and of itself.

   It is pretty cool that a small-business was able to actually advertise
   during the Super Bowl. Unfortunately, this specific commercial left a
   whole heck of a lot to be desired.

   It lasted a total of 20 seconds and included the main character
   drinking coffee. Really, there wasn't much more here. Well, unless you
   want to count the ad fading to some sort of an unexplained voyage at
   sea.

   Pro tip. Next time you decide to feature a small business, actually
   make it a halfway decent commercial.

   Do we really need to see actual hot dogs (the breed) dressed like the
   food to think about Heinz condiments? Do we then need to see actual
   humans dressed like ketchup and mustard?

   This was an absolutely waste of money for a company that failed to get
   creative at every possible turn. It was about as bland as a John Kerry
   stump speech, making us wonder whether his wife, the actual Heinz
   heiress, employed him as the creative director in this disaster.

   Remember when fragrance company was the in thing? Me neither. Either
   way, Axe seemed really desperate to have people talking about it
   following this horrendous example of a television ad.

   When rhyming goes wrong. That's pretty much the best way to depict this
   dumpster fire. The entire commercial was spent rhyming one word with
   another, none of which had anything to actually do with the product the
   commercial was pimping.

   There was a time when Axe actually put out some pretty darn good
   commercials. Much like the quality of its product, that's taken a deep
   nosedive.
