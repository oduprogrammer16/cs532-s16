Beyoncé’s Radical Halftime Statement

   As Coldplay blandly strained for the universal, she and Bruno Mars
   pulled off something more specific and more daring.

   What a perfect Beyoncé [52]song name: “Formation.” All great pop
   involves people acting in formation. So does all great change. And
   while fans scream that Beyoncé’s a “queen” and “goddess,” her core
   appeal really is as a drill sergeant. With Beyoncé in command,
   greatness is scalable, achievable, for the collective. Everyone waves
   their hands to the same beat. Everyone walks around like they have hot
   sauce in their bag.

   But in pop and in politics, “everyone” is a loaded term. Stars as
   ubiquitous as Beyoncé have haters, the “albino alligators” who
   “Formation” informs us she twirls upon. And in a more general
   historical sense, “everyone” can be a dangerous illusion that elevates
   one point of view as universal while minimizing others. Beyoncé gets
   all of this, it seems. As a pop star, she surely wants to have as broad
   a reach as possible. But as an artist, she has a specific message, born
   of a specific experience, meaningful to specific people. Rather than
   pretend otherwise, she’s going to make art about the tension implied by
   this dynamic. She’s going to show up to Super Bowl with a phalanx of
   women dressed as Black Panthers.

   The poor guys of Coldplay, meanwhile, actually think they can work
   solely at the level of the universal. “Wherever you are, we’re in this
   together,” Chris Martin cried out, early on, last night. I don’t want
   to diss that intention, nor the take-home message at the end: “Believe
   in Love.” But from their first hit, “Yellow,” to their recent
   Holi-appropriating music video with Beyoncé, to their pan-cultural
   rainbow rally at Levi’s Stadium last night, their theme has only been
   about love to the extent that it’s been about how everyone loves
   colors. It’s music about being awed by the blandest kind of harmony:
   ROYGBIV, yeah yeah yeah!

     __________________________________________________________________

   Even at this level, universality’s unachievable. You could see it in
   the staging: a legion of human Pikmin with flower-pedal umbrellas, a
   youth orchestra’s members playing tie-dyed violins, and Coldplay in the
   middle of it all, wearing white. One shouldn’t politicize this choice
   too much. If their set had been the entirety of the halftime show—15
   minutes of Coldplay spewing mediocrity from the center of a world of
   colors—the memory would have been totally eclipsed by [57]the Vine of
   Eli Manning looking [58]ambivalent (the music wasn’t going to save
   anyone because the sound system was so shoddy—maybe short-circuited by
   [59]the woo guy?). But once Beyoncé and Bruno Mars showed up,
   discussions were inevitable. Contrasts needed to be drawn.

   Both Beyoncé and Bruno wore black. They dressed the same as the people
   they stood shoulder to shoulder with. And then, before being
   interrupted by a strange retrospective video about past halftimes, they
   offered a reminder that synchronized dancing can be the best kind of
   spectacle there is—better than Left Shark, better than a middle finger
   to the camera, better than a crotch slide from Springsteen. There was
   no racial subtext to this, just text. Mars’s crew was B-boying.
   Beyoncé’s was channeling black radical movements and Michael Jackson in
   1993. These were displays of cultural power coming from specific
   places, with specific meanings. They were rooted in history, but
   [60]obviously spoke to the present.

   In the short time since it arrived online without warning the day
   before the Super Bowl, “Formation” has already generated a monograph’s
   [61]worth [62]of [63]writings about Beyoncé’s choice to tie her famous
   swagger explicitly (and hilariously, and cleverly) to her race, gender,
   and cultural heritage—to “Jackson Five nostrils” and dates to Red
   Lobster. The video features her on stoops and in parking lots and in
   old-money New Orleans drawing rooms, looking fly. Everyone has the
   potential to appreciate her infectious attitude, the song’s strange
   squeaky beat, and the video’s instantly iconic visuals. But among the
   group of people she is directly addressing, many say “Formation” feels
   like something more than just a great pop song—it feels life-giving and
   maybe even revolutionary.

   But forgoing the universal also involves risk, as Beyoncé surely knew.
   The aggregating of social-media users who find her totally humane
   imagery “anti-police,” or who hear a song about a person’s lived
   experience and reply with the inanity of “all lives matter,” [64]has
   begun. So too has concern trolling about her acclaim from people who’ve
   never connected to her music. If you find “Formation” tuneless or
   offensive, fine. Just don’t go impugning the motives of all the people
   in the weeks to come walking down the street in a very specific rhythm,
   internally chanting “I slay.” Beyoncé no longer asks that everyone get
   in formation, and that’s why so many people probably will.

   A lot of headlines today say that Beyoncé won the Super Bowl, and [65]a
   lot of memes are fixing on the moment toward the end when she, Mars,
   and Martin all sang together. It was meant to be a beautiful sight, but
   it ended up feeling awkward; Martin seemed weak, pitiful, next to the
   two of them and what they’d just done. There are probably a lot of
   reasons for that perception. One might be that he had pretended to
   stand for everything, but actually stood for very little. Beyoncé did
   not make that mistake.

Deconstructing Kendrick Lamar's Grammys Performance
          + [79]Spencer Kornhaber
       With a jailbreak, massive bonfire, and new song, he shed light on
       an internal struggle caused by external conflict.
       Kendrick Lamar’s performance at the Grammys has been widely
       described as “fiery”—a nice way to say there were pyrotechnics both
       of the actual and emotional sort. But there was more than fire,
       too. The set was obviously political; it was obviously powerful.
       What exactly did it say?
       Lamar arrived bound to other mock-inmates, slouchily walking with a
       hint of rhythm: every few beats, a twitch. This was clearly an
       image for the [80]age of mass black incarceration. From the jail
       cells, jazz players noodled softly, queasily. Lamar put his chained
       hands over the mic and said “I’m the biggest hypocrite of 2015,”
       the first words of “Blacker the Berry.” The rhythm section suddenly
       stabbed in—bam, bam—and Lamar flinched before launching into
       another line.

The Power of Buying Less by Buying Better
          + [83]Elizabeth Cline
       A number of new online fashion retailers are capitalizing on
       consumers’ desires to purchase clothing that lasts.
       According to a recent survey commissioned by the British charity
       Barnardo’s, a majority of women’s garments are worn [84]a mere
       seven times before being pushed to the back of the closet or tossed
       into the garbage.
       Combatting this wastefulness is at the heart of a growing number of
       clothing brands offering alternatives to so-called “fast fashion,”
       the trendy, throwaway method of selling clothes pioneered by
       companies such as H&M, and the cultural force to blame for the
       world’s overflowing and underutilized closets. Among the other
       startups positioning themselves as durable and ethical alternatives
       to throwaway fads are the online retailers Zady, Cuyana, Of a Kind,
       Everlane, and The 30 Year Sweatshirt.

The Pragmatic Case for Bernie Sanders
          + [87]Christopher D. Cook
       Political and social change emanates from persistent pressure for a
       just world, not settling for what is “realistic” before even
       getting to the negotiating table.
       As Bernie Sanders defies expectations with a resounding New
       Hampshire victory and a virtual tie in Iowa, Democratic Party
       leaders still [88]insist Hillary Clinton is the pragmatic choice to
       beat Republicans and bring effective leadership and change—if
       incremental—to Washington. Clinton and her supporters frame the
       race, and her appeal, as a matter of “ready on day one” leadership
       and “get things done” practicality. But what does the record show,
       and what do leadership and pragmatism really mean?
       On the pragmatics of electability, nearly every major national poll
       consistently [89]shows Sanders equaling or bettering Clinton
       against all Republicans. [90]Polls show Sanders nearly tied with
       Clinton nationally and rising. On [91]electability, if anything,
       Sanders has the edge right now. There is nothing empirical to
       suggest Clinton’s superior electability—quite the contrary given
       her loss to Barack Obama in 2008 and her flagging [92]campaign this
       year. While Clinton might gain more moderate Independents
       (particularly against a polarizing Republican nominee), Sanders can
       inspire massive Democratic and liberal Independent turnout and
       likely [93]win over many white working-class swing voters.

The Senate Awaits Its Doomed Nominee
          + [96]Russell Berman
       Charges of judicial hypocrisy broke out among lawmakers as
       President Obama weighed naming a replacement for Antonin Scalia,
       who might not even get a vote.
       Updated on February 16, 2016
       Within the next few weeks, President Obama will call up one of the
       nation’s top legal minds and initiate one of the trickier
       conversations of his presidency. He will offer him or her the honor
       of a lifetime—an appointment to the Supreme Court—and then he’ll
       share a caveat they already know: It’s a nomination that’s probably
       doomed from the start.
       Congratulations?
       That is one of the many awkward complications of the constitutional
       confrontation that has [97]erupted in record time following the
       unexpected death on Saturday of Justice Antonin Scalia. Over the
       weekend, Senate Republicans up for reelection in 2016 largely fell
       in line behind Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s declaration that
       it should be “the next president” who appoints Scalia’s replacement
       on the high court. Their support dampens Democratic hopes that
       electoral pressure from Republicans in swing states would force
       McConnell to give Obama’s nominee a fair hearing and a floor vote
       in the several months.

Anti-Vaxxers Aren't Stupid
          + [100]Emma Green
       Doctors, pharmaceutical companies, and the government have a lot of
       power over children's lives. That can make parents act
       irrationally.
       Among scientists and in the media, anti-vaxxers have earned a
       certain reputation. “They just don’t know something, or they’re
       anti-science, or there’s just something pathological about them,”
       as Mark Largent, a professor at Michigan State University and the
       author of Vaccine: The Debate in Modern America, characterized it.
       There is near-consensus among researchers that widespread
       immunization is crucial for children and American public health.
       Yet, according to Largent, 40 percent of American parents [101]have
       either refused or delayed a recommended vaccine for one of their
       kids.
       The question is: Why?
       In Largent’s view, the answer has to do with imbalances of power.
       Many parents feel helpless and overwhelmed within a dysfunctional
       health-care system, he argued; on an average vaccine schedule, kids
       may get up to 25 inoculations in their first 18 months, and up to
       six in a single doctor’s visit. In interviews with people who seek
       out waivers in Michigan, he and his colleagues found that
       vaccine-skeptical parents show “tremendously high trust in medical
       communities,” he said. “Who don’t they trust? The feds, and
       pharma.” This research, along with [102]rhetoric from recent
       political fights, suggests some parents may feel uncertain about
       vaccines partly because they’re skeptical of pharmaceutical
       companies, whose profit motives mix with their vaccine-promotion
       campaigns. And while state governments can mandate immunization,
       this may end up [103]pushing parents away from the public-school
       system if they feel that regulations are forcing them to make
       certain decisions about their children’s health.

Antonin Scalia's Secrets
          + [106]Russell Berman
       The late justice once discussed running for vice president and
       later gave President Obama an unsolicited recommendation for the
       Supreme Court.
       Supreme Court justices seldom publish memoirs. But to judge by the
       never-before-told stories that have come out about Antonin Scalia
       in the days since his death, his autobiography would have been as
       compelling as the justice himself.
       Vice President Scalia?
       The most surprising tale came from former House Speaker John
       Boehner, who emerged from his post-resignation hibernation to
       reveal that in 1996, he met with Scalia about the possibility that
       Bob Dole would choose him as his vice-presidential running mate.
       Boehner was then the fourth-ranking member of the House Republican
       leadership, and as [107]he writes in the Independent Journal
       Review, Scalia agreed to meet for a “clandestine” lunch with
       Boehner and his chief of staff, Barry Jackson.

Masters of Love
          + [110]Emily Esfahani Smith
       Science says lasting relationships come down to—you guessed
       it—kindness and generosity.
       Every day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year,
       about 13,000 American couples will say “I do,” committing to a
       lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and
       love that will carry them forward to their final days on this
       earth.
       Except, of course, it doesn’t work out that way for most people.
       The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and
       separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the
       people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy
       marriages, as psychologist Ty Tashiro points out in his book The
       Science of Happily Ever After, which was published earlier this
       year.
       Social scientists first started studying marriages by observing
       them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: Married
       couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the
       impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken
       marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on
       couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine
       what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was
       each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as Tolstoy claimed, or
       did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common?

XY Bias: How Male Biology Students See Their Female Peers
          + [113]Ed Yong
       In three large classes, men overrated the abilities of male
       students above equally talented and outspoken women.
       Over the last three years, [114]Sarah Eddy and [115]Daniel Grunspan
       have asked over 1,700 biology undergraduates at the University of
       Washington to name classmates whom they thought were “strong in
       their understanding of classroom material.” [116]The results were
       worrying but predictable. The male students underestimated their
       female peers, over-nominating other men over better-performing
       women.
       Put it this way: To the men in these classes, a woman would need to
       get an A to get the same prestige as a man getting a B.
       “A lot of people make the assumption that issues of gender in
       biology are gone because so many women enroll,” says Eddy. “But we
       know there are strong unconscious biases equating science to males.
       They’re just there in the air.”

The New Yorker Presents: Quirky, Eclectic, Fascinating
          + [119]David Sims
       The new Amazon show offers an uneven but intriguing mix of
       hard-hitting journalism and whimsical storytelling.
       The kind of dramatic whiplash offered by The New Yorker Presents is
       rare indeed among television shows. The new Amazon series, an
       anthology of half-hour episodes made up of smaller vignettes,
       covers the broad range of topics you might encounter in any one
       issue of the storied magazine, from a chilling documentary on a
       police shooting of a homeless man in Albuquerque to more whimsical
       humor pieces starring Alan Cumming or Paul Giamatti, all delivered
       in a necessarily breezy tone that avoids an air of self-importance.
       The result is a mixed bag, but one that—like the magazine—offers
       the opportunity to pick and choose as you go.
       In that, the show seems well suited to Amazon’s bulk-release
       strategy, and as with many streaming series released in their
       entirety, it’s good to go into The New Yorker Presents knowing that
       it starts a little slow. The first episode includes an interview
       with the performance artist Marina Abramović that only skims the
       surface of her rich (and controversial) body of work. That’s
       followed by a humor piece, scripted by Simon Rich (a New Yorker
       contributor and the creator of the TV show Man Seeking Woman), that
       has an intriguing cast (Cumming as God, speaking to a demented man
       played by Brett Gelman) but provokes only mild chuckles. The New
       Yorker’s humor isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, of course, but its
       profiles usually go much deeper, making the half-hour format feel
       somewhat limiting.

Educating an Original Thinker
          + [122]Jessica Lahey
       How teachers and parents can identify and cultivate children who
       think creatively and unconventionally
       In his new book, [123]Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the
       World, the writer, Wharton professor,[124] and erstwhile magician
       Adam Grant explores the circumstances that give rise to truly
       original thinkers. Through stories of business “originals” such as
       the Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio, and the Warby Parker
       co-founder Neil Blumenthal, he explains how unorthodox thinking can
       result in unprecedented success or—if shaped by groupthink or
       myopic vision—miserable failure.
       Grant is a gifted educator himself, and, as[125] Wharton’s top
       rated teacher for the past four years, knows a little something
       about identifying and cultivating original thinking in his
       students. I asked Grant about the role teachers play in educating
       original children, and how teachers and parents alike can protect
       what’s special in these original children—traits that have the
       potential to disrupt lesson plans today, but, if nurtured and
       protected, may just change the world tomorrow. Below is a lightly
       edited and condensed version of our conversation.
