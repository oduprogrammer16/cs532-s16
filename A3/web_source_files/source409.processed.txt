Bill and Hillary Clinton’s Women Victims To Hit Campaign Trail

   Bill-Clinton-cigar-3

   by [25]John Nolte8 Feb 2016[26]0
   8 Feb, 2016 8 Feb, 2016

   Reuters [27]reports that Roger Stone, a Republican strategist and
   Donald Trump supporter, is putting together a group of women to
   campaign against Hillary Clinton, should the former Secretary of State
   win the Democrat nomination. The political action committee, originally
   created last year with the name Women Against Hillary, is now called
   the Rape Accountability Project for Education PAC, or RAPE PAC.

   Kathleen Willey, a Democrat who once volunteered in Bill Clinton’s
   White House, is in talks to be the national spokesperson for the Stone
   group. Willey claims that in 1993, in the Oval Office, Bill Clinton
   pinned her to a wall and groped her. “This gives me more of an
   opportunity to get this message out to young voters who weren’t even
   born or don’t even remember what happened and to the women who have
   suffered,” Willey [28]told Reuters.

   Stone told Reuters. “[The Clintons] are going to be confronted every
   day, on radio, on television, on billboards.”

   Willey is not alone. Paula Jones has popped back into the news during
   this campaign. In the 1990’s then-President Bill Clinton settled a
   sexual harassment with Jones. Juanita Broaddrick, who claims Bill
   Clinton outright raped her, has also been back in the public eye,
   including through social media via [29]her Twitter account.

   As someone who lived through the 1990’s I can tell you that the DC
   Media was every bit as ugly as Hillary when it came to personally
   destroying these women. To protect their alleged abuser, a sitting
   Democrat president, the media was a White House ally in attacking these
   women as liars, stalkers, psychos, and golddiggers.

   The fact that Bill Clinton ended up settling with Jones, ended up
   admitting he had lied about his affair with a White House intern, or
   that Broaddrick has contemporaneous witnesses she told about the
   assault, did nothing to alter the DC Media’s role in personally
   destroying any and all Clinton accusers.

   This is why God invented the super PAC.

   In 2016, Stone and Willey can go right over the heads of Hillary’s
   media.

   Free speech is a beautiful thing.
