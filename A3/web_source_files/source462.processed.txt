   1 Gialy's is a new Italian and steakhouse restaurant located in
   Jamestown, NY that opened in 2015. Owner Anthony Cusimano arrived at
   the name Gialy's for his new restaurant by combining the names of his
   two daughters, Giana and Alyssa. Gialy’s, formerly Town Club, was
   renovated and refurbished from the kitchen and bar area to the
   flooring. Gialy's features new lounge area in the front of the
   restaurant complete with large picture windows overlooking the view of
   downtown Jamestown.

   Although we’re rather new in town, customers are already raving about
   how much they love Gialy’s. Read what a few of them have to say about
   their dining experience.

   “A wonderful evening...Anthony was so warm and welcoming.....the pasta
   primavera was outstanding.....full of summer vegetables in a
   garlic-butter sauce that was delicious, but not overpowering.....can’t
   wait to go back and try some of their other dishes!” –Lisa P., Facebook
