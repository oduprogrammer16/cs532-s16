It comes from your own actions.&amp;quot; What do you think?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;I am not a product of my circumstances. I am a product of my decisions.&amp;quot; Thoughts?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;I attribute my success to this: I never gave or took any excuse.&amp;quot; Do you agree?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;I have learned over the years that when one’s mind is made up, this diminishes fear.&amp;quot; What do you think?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;I would rather die of passion than of boredom.&amp;quot; Do you agree?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;If the wind will not serve, take to the oars.&amp;quot; What do you think?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;If you can dream it, you can achieve it.&amp;quot; What do you think?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;If you do what you’ve always done, you’ll get what you’ve always gotten.&amp;quot; Thoughts?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;If you want to lift yourself up, lift up someone else.&amp;quot; What do you think?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;If you’re offered a seat on a rocket ship, don’t ask what seat! Just get on.&amp;quot; Do you agree?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;In order to succeed, your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure.&amp;quot; What do you think?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.&amp;quot; Do you agree?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;It’s not the years in your life that count. It’s the life in your years.&amp;quot; Thoughts?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;Life is 10% what happens to me and 90% of how I react to it.&amp;quot; Thoughts?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.&amp;quot; Thoughts?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;Life is what happens to you while you’re busy making other plans.&amp;quot; Thoughts?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;Life isn’t about getting and having, it’s about giving and being.&amp;quot; Do you agree?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one’s courage.&amp;quot; Do you agree?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;Limitations live only in our minds. But if we use our imaginations, our possibilities become limitless.&amp;quot; Thoughts?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;People will forget what you say, people will forget what you do, but people will never forget how you make them feel.&amp;quot; Thoughts?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;Remember that not getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck.&amp;quot; What do you think?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value.&amp;quot; What do you think?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;The best revenge is massive success.&amp;quot; Thoughts?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.&amp;quot; Thoughts?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;The mind is everything. What you think you become.&amp;quot; Do you agree?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don’t have any.&amp;quot; What do you think?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be.&amp;quot; Thoughts?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;The only way to do great work is to love what you do.&amp;quot; Thoughts?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;The person who says it cannot be done should not interrupt the person who is doing it.&amp;quot; What do you think?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;The question isn’t who is going to let me; it’s who is going to stop me.&amp;quot; What do you think?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;There is only one way to avoid criticism: do nothing, say nothing, and be nothing.&amp;quot; What do you think?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;Too many of us are not living our dreams because we are living our fears.&amp;quot; Do you agree?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference. &amp;quot; Thoughts?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;We become what we think about.&amp;quot; What do you think?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when people are afraid of the light.&amp;quot; Do you agree?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve.&amp;quot; Do you agree?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it.&amp;quot; Do you agree?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;When I let go of what I am, I become what I might be.&amp;quot; Do you agree?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;Whether you think you can or you think you can’t, you’re right.&amp;quot; Do you agree?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;Winning isn’t everything, but wanting to win is.&amp;quot; Do you agree?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;You become what you believe.&amp;quot; What do you think?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;You can never cross the ocean until you have the courage to lose sight of the shore.&amp;quot; Do you agree?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;You can’t fall if you don’t climb. But there’s no joy in living your whole life on the ground.&amp;quot; Do you agree?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;You can’t use up creativity. The more you use, the more you have.&amp;quot; Do you agree?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;You may be disappointed if you fail, but you are doomed if you don’t try.&amp;quot; What do you think?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;You lose 100% of the chances you don&amp;#39;t take.&amp;quot; What do you think?&#34;,&#34;&amp;quot;Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.&amp;quot; What do you think?&#34;,&#34;Do you have an unusual talent? What is it?&#34;,&#34;Do you know any other languages?
