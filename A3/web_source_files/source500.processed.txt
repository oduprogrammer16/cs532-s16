     Black and white image of Saturn's moon Tethys in front of Saturn's
                                  rings.

   Ices and Shadows
   February 8, 2016                               [75]Full-Res: PIA18355
   Saturn's moon Tethys appears to float between two sets of rings in this
   view from NASA's Cassini spacecraft, but it's just a trick of geometry.
     The rings, which are seen nearly edge-on, are the dark bands above
    Tethys, while their curving shadows paint the planet at the bottom of
                                 the image.

    Tethys (660 miles or 1,062 kilometers across) has a surface composed
   mostly of water ice, much like Saturn's rings. Water ice dominates the
    icy surfaces in the the far reaches of our solar system, but ammonia
                     and methane ices also can be found.

      The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
   wide-angle camera on Nov. 23, 2015. North on Tethys is up. The view was
        obtained at a distance of approximately 40,000 miles (65,000
    kilometers) from Tethys. Image scale is 2.4 miles (4 kilometers) per
                                   pixel.

   The Cassini mission is a cooperative project of NASA, ESA (the European
       Space Agency) and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion
     Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in
    Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate,
      Washington. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were
   designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center
        is based at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado.
