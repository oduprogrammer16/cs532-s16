Beyoncé set for SoL show

   Published: 08 February, 2016
   by Kate Smith

   Beyoncé to perform at the home of SAFC this summer!

   Beyoncé, one of the biggest female artists of all time, is set to light
   up the North East in the summer following the announcement of her
   hotly-anticipated world tour.

   Recognised as the most powerful woman in the music industry and
   Billboard’s Artist of the Millennium, Beyoncé will take to the stage at
   Sunderland’s Stadium of Light in what will be the prestigious opening
   night of the European leg of the Formation World Tour, on Tuesday 28
   June, 2016.

   The show will be the iconic singers’ first-ever stadium performance in
   the North East, with Sunderland selected as one of only five UK venues
   to host the global superstar and one of only two stadium venues in
   England, the other being Wembley.

   The Crazy in Love star is heralded as one of the biggest and best
   entertainers in the world and one of the most successful female artists
   of all time. She has sold over 118 million records as a solo artist and
   a further 60 million with her former band, Destiny’s Child.

   The Formation World Tour is Beyoncé’s first solo tour since her
   ambitious Mrs. Carter Show World Tour in 2013. The sold-out tour
   spanning two years and five continents thrilled nearly two million fans
   and was hailed by critics worldwide. During the summer of 2014, Beyoncé
   and Jay Z launched the six-week On The Run Tour, playing major stadiums
   in the US. They ended the tour in Paris, France in September 2014 with
   two additional dates that were filmed for an HBO Special that was
   nominated for an Emmy Award.

   Speaking about the concert, Sunderland AFC’s commercial director, Gary
   Hutchinson, said: “This concert represents a huge win not only for the
   Stadium of Light but the North East region too. Given Beyoncé’s iconic
   status in today’s music scene, this is without doubt the biggest
   concert announcement we have ever made.

   “In a career spanning almost 20 years, she has consistently produced
   global hits and is one of the greatest artistes in recent history. To
   have her perform here in Sunderland, in her prime, will be a
   once-in-a-lifetime experience for North East music fans and we can’t
   wait to welcome her to the city and the stadium.”

   Tickets will be priced from just £43.50, but with unprecedented demand
   expected, fans are advised to secure their seat what will be the
   hottest show of the summer as soon as possible.
