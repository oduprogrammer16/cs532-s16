Cough

   A cough often follows a cold, and most don't need an antibiotic - even
   though they can last up to three weeks. Read your Cough Timeline below,
   and then get advice on What to Do.

Your Cough Timeline

     * 1 - 3 days
       Most coughs are caused by viral infections like colds or flu and
       will usually come with other symptoms like runny nose, fever, sore
       throat, ear ache and general aches and pains.

       Usually you do not need to see the doctor.  There is no quick way
       of getting rid of a cough. It will usually clear up after your
       immune system has defeated the bug that is causing it.  The
       simplest and cheapest way to ease a tickly cough is with any of the
       common over the counter remedies. For chesty coughs, cough
       expectorants help bring phlegm up so that coughing is easier.
     * 4 - 7 days
       By this stage, many tickly and chesty coughs will start to improve,
       but sometimes coughs can last longer.
       If  you need them, you can still take over the counter remedies for
       tickly coughs and cough expectorants for chesty coughs.
     * 7 - 21 days
       Your cough should be better by now, but some coughs can last up to
       three weeks.
       But typically you should be feeling better by now. If your cough
       lasts longer than three weeks you should see your doctor.
