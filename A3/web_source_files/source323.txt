			<h2 class="article-excerpt" itemprop="alternativeHeadline">No need to throw out the chocolate, booze, and carbs. Pope Francis has a different idea for fasting this year.</h2>
			<div class="clipper-content">
				<p>Christians around the world mark the beginning of Lent with the celebration of Ash Wednesday. This ancient day and season has a surprising modern appeal. Priests and pastors often tell you that outside of Christmas, more people show up to church on Ash Wednesday than any other day of the year&mdash;including Easter. But this mystique isn&#8217;t reserved for Christians alone. The customs that surround the season have a quality to them that transcend religion.</p>
<p>Perhaps most notable is the act of fasting. While Catholics fast on Ash Wednesday and on Fridays during the Lenten season, many people&mdash;religious or not&mdash;take up <a style="background-color:initial;" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-25549805" target="_blank">this increasingly popular discipline</a> during the year.</p>
<p><strong>MORE </strong><a href="http://time.com/3713500/lenten-fast-twitter-ash-wednesday/" target="_blank">Here&rsquo;s What People On Twitter Say They&rsquo;re Giving Up For Lent</a></p>
<p>But Pope Francis has asked us to reconsider the heart of this activity this Lenten season. According to Francis, fasting must never become superficial. <a href="http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/cardinal-bergoglio-s-lenten-message-for-buenos-aires" target="_blank">He often quotes the early Christian mystic John Chrysostom</a> who said: &#8220;No act of virtue can be great if it is not followed by advantage for others. So, no matter how much time you spend fasting, no matter how much you sleep on a hard floor and eat ashes and sigh continually, if you do no good to others, you do nothing great.&#8221;</p>
<p>But this isn&#8217;t to downplay the role of sacrifice during the Lenten season. Lent is a good time for penance and self-denial. But once again, <a href="http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/messages/lent/documents/papa-francesco_20131226_messaggio-quaresima2014.html" target="_blank">Francis reminds us that these activities must truly enrich others</a>: &#8220;I distrust a charity that costs nothing and does not hurt.&#8221;</p>
<div class="article-video"><div class="video-wrapper brightcove-size-large" data-pos="1" data-continuous="1" data-playlist="0"><object id="bc-video-2916220526001-1" class="BrightcoveExperience"><param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"><param name="width" value="100%"><param name="height" value="100%"><param name="playerID" value="1847503743001"><param name="isVid" value="true"><param name="isUI" value="true"><param name="dynamicStreaming" value="true"><param name="videoSmoothing" value="true"><param name="linkBaseURL" value="http://ti.me/1LhpC1Z"><param name="includeAPI" value="true"><param name="templateLoadHandler" value="Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateLoad"><param name="templateReadyHandler" value="Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateReady"><param name="wmode" value="opaque"><param name="htmlFallback" value="true"><param name="@videoPlayer" value="2916220526001"></object></div></div>
<p>So, if we&#8217;re going to fast from anything this Lent, Francis suggests that even more than candy or alcohol, we fast from indifference towards others.</p>
<p>In his annual Lenten message, <a href="http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/messages/lent/documents/papa-francesco_20141004_messaggio-quaresima2015.html" target="_blank">the pope writes</a>, &#8220;Indifference to our neighbor and to God also represents a real temptation for us Christians. Each year during Lent we need to hear once more the voice of the prophets who cry out and trouble our conscience.&#8221;</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3714056"></div>
<p>Describing this phenomenon he calls the <em>globalization of indifference</em>, <a href="http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20131124_evangelii-gaudium.html" target="_blank">Francis writes</a> that &#8220;whenever our interior life becomes caught up in its own interests and concerns, there is no longer room for others, no place for the poor. God&#8217;s voice is no longer heard, the quiet joy of his love is no longer felt, and the desire to do good fades.&#8221; He continues that, &#8220;We end up being incapable of feeling compassion at the outcry of the poor, weeping for other people&#8217;s pain, and feeling a need to help them, as though all this were someone else&#8217;s responsibility and not our own.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>MORE </b><a href="http://time.com/3710419/pope-new-cardinals/" target="_blank">Pope to New Cardinals: Practice Compassion, Be Open to All</a></p>
<p>But when we fast from this indifference, we can began to feast on love. In fact, Lent is the perfect time to learn how to love again. Jesus&mdash;the great protagonist of this holy season&mdash;certainly showed us the way. In him, God descends all the way down to bring everyone up. In his life and his ministry, no one is excluded.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you giving up for Lent?&#8221; It&#8217;s a question a lot of people will get these next few days. If you want to change your body, perhaps alcohol and candy is the way to go. But if you want to change your heart, a harder fast is needed. This narrow road is gritty, but it isn&#8217;t sterile. It will make room in ourselves to experience a love that can make us whole and set us free.</p>
<p>Now that&#8217;s something worth fasting for.</p>

According to Francis, fasting must never become superficial. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zenit.org\/en\/articles\/cardinal-bergoglio-s-lenten-message-for-buenos-aires\" target=\"_blank\">He often quotes the early Christian mystic John Chrysostom<\/a> who said: &#8220;No act of virtue can be great if it is not followed by advantage for others. So, no matter how much time you spend fasting, no matter how much you sleep on a hard floor and eat ashes and sigh continually, if you do no good to others, you do nothing great.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But this isn&#8217;t to downplay the role of sacrifice during the Lenten season. Lent is a good time for penance and self-denial. But once again, <a href=\"http:\/\/w2.vatican.va\/content\/francesco\/en\/messages\/lent\/documents\/papa-francesco_20131226_messaggio-quaresima2014.html\" target=\"_blank\">Francis reminds us that these activities must truly enrich others<\/a>: &#8220;I distrust a charity that costs nothing and does not hurt.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"article-video\"><div class=\"video-wrapper brightcove-size-large\" data-pos=\"3\" data-continuous=\"1\" data-playlist=\"0\"><object id=\"bc-video-2916220526001-3\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/ti.me\/1LhpC1Z\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"2916220526001\"><\/object><\/div><\/div>\n<p>So, if we&#8217;re going to fast from anything this Lent, Francis suggests that even more than candy or alcohol, we fast from indifference towards others.<\/p>\n<p>In his annual Lenten message, <a href=\"http:\/\/w2.vatican.va\/content\/francesco\/en\/messages\/lent\/documents\/papa-francesco_20141004_messaggio-quaresima2015.html\" target=\"_blank\">the pope writes<\/a>, &#8220;Indifference to our neighbor and to God also represents a real temptation for us Christians. Each year during Lent we need to hear once more the voice of the prophets who cry out and trouble our conscience.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3714056\"><\/div>\n<p>Describing this phenomenon he calls the <em>globalization of indifference<\/em>, <a href=\"http:\/\/w2.vatican.va\/content\/francesco\/en\/apost_exhortations\/documents\/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20131124_evangelii-gaudium.html\" target=\"_blank\">Francis writes<\/a> that &#8220;whenever our interior life becomes caught up in its own interests and concerns, there is no longer room for others, no place for the poor. God&#8217;s voice is no longer heard, the quiet joy of his love is no longer felt, and the desire to do good fades.&#8221; He continues that, &#8220;We end up being incapable of feeling compassion at the outcry of the poor, weeping for other people&#8217;s pain, and feeling a need to help them, as though all this were someone else&#8217;s responsibility and not our own.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><b>MORE <\/b><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3710419\/pope-new-cardinals\/\" target=\"_blank\">Pope to New Cardinals: Practice Compassion, Be Open to All<\/a><\/p>\n<p>But when we fast from this indifference, we can began to feast on love. In fact, Lent is the perfect time to learn how to love again. Jesus&mdash;the great protagonist of this holy season&mdash;certainly showed us the way. In him, God descends all the way down to bring everyone up. In his life and his ministry, no one is excluded.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;What are you giving up for Lent?&#8221; It&#8217;s a question a lot of people will get these next few days. If you want to change your body, perhaps alcohol and candy is the way to go. But if you want to change your heart, a harder fast is needed. This narrow road is gritty, but it isn&#8217;t sterile. It will make room in ourselves to experience a love that can make us whole and set us free.<\/p>\n<p>Now that&#8217;s something worth fasting for.<\/p>\n<p><em>Read next: <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3713126\/ash-wednesday\/?xid=time_readnext\" target=\"_blank\">3 Things to Know About Ash Wednesday<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"72446\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"newsletter-shortcode the-brief\">\n<form action=\"http:\/\/pages.email.time.com\/web-opt-in\/\" method=\"post\" target=\"time_brief_popup\" onsubmit=\"window.open(this.action, 'time_brief_popup', 'width=486,height=250');\">\n    <label class=\"intro\"><small>Sign up for<\/small> <span class=\"no-wrap\">THE <strong class=\"time-red\">BRIEF<\/strong><\/span> <small class=\"and-more\">and more<\/small> <small class=\"example\"><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/newsletter\/the-brief\/\" target=\"_blank\">view example<\/a><\/small><\/label>\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"newsletter_name\" value=\"THE_BRIEF\">\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"source\" value=\"shortcode\">\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"success_url\" value=\"http:\/\/pages.email.time.com\/thank-you\/\">\n    <input type=\"text\" pattern=\"[A-Za-z0-9._+-]{3,}@[a-zA-Z]{3,}([.]{1}[a-zA-Z]{2,}|[.]{1}[a-zA-Z]{2,}[.]{1}[a-zA-Z]{2,})\" class=\"text input-field email\" name=\"email_address\" placeholder=\"Email\" title=\"Valid email address required\" required>\n    <input type=\"submit\" class=\"submit button\" value=\"Submit\">\n\n<\/form>\n<\/div>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/newsletter\/the-brief\/?sl_autoplay=true&amp;xid=spl-fullbrief-article\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Listen to the most important stories of the day.<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<script async type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"\/\/tracking.skyword.com\/tracker.js?contentId=281474979382531\"><\/script>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Ideas","slug":"ideas","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/ideas\/","description":"TIME Ideas hosts the world's leading voices, providing commentary and expertise on the most compelling events in news, society, and culture.

Dear God! Why are all their pictures from vacations?<\/p>\n<p>Who&rsquo;s giving out these cruises?<\/p>\n<p>Seeing this type of stuff used to bother me for three reasons:<\/p>\n<p>First, I felt like I was &ldquo;behind&rdquo; for my age. At 24, I had close friends who were moving up the corporate ladder quickly and making what I thought was big money. Other friends were doing really cool, exciting work getting doctorates or professional degrees.<\/p>\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t want either of those, but I couldn&rsquo;t help feeling like a dweeb talking to them sometimes &mdash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rich20something.com\/posted-this-on-my-facebook-page-tonight-thought-id-share\/\" target=\"_blank\">I even vented about it in an open letter.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>When they asked me what I was doing, all I could really tell them was that I was still working at a restaurant and trying to &#8220;figure things out.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Second, I felt like nobody had my back. I knew I wanted to start my own business(es), but I didn&rsquo;t have any mentors to give me solid advice or a step-by-step action plan. I didn&rsquo;t have anybody close to me who knew the ropes and could help me if I fell down. I wanted someone to tell me &ldquo;do this, then do that.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Unlike the corporate world or graduate school, there are really no guidelines or &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; for entrepreneurship. You pretty much have to figure it out yourself. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so scary.<\/p>\n<p>Third and last, I felt like I was in a vacuum. I was really the only person I knew in &ldquo;real life&rdquo; who wanted to be an entrepreneur. All the people at the places I worked at&hellip;they just wanted to clock in&hellip;.day after day.<\/p>\n<p>I wanted to meet other people like me. People who were driven to get more from their lives and really wanted to create something new.<\/p>\n<p>People I could bounce ideas off of and wouldn&rsquo;t make me feel &ldquo;weird&rdquo; for wanting to brainstorm or talk about personal development. I always knew that if I was able to fill my entire life with the type of people that I wanted to be like, success was pretty much guaranteed.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-4152490\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"article-video\"><div class=\"video-wrapper brightcove-size-large\" data-pos=\"5\" data-continuous=\"1\" data-playlist=\"0\"><object id=\"bc-video-4105230971001-5\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/ti.me\/1UAQcHE\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4105230971001\"><\/object><\/div><\/div>\n<p>Here is how I got over the jealousy. For the past four years, I&rsquo;ve hustled to connect with other entrepreneurs who are doing amazing work. I&rsquo;ve gone out of my way to build mentorship relationships with startup founders, millionaires and high-performers in all fields.<\/p>\n<p>Why?<\/p>\n<p>Because I was sick of feeling jealous of people who are doing well. I realized that if I wanted to become one of them, I had to do whatever it took to get into their peer group.<\/p>\n<p>And I did. But It definitely didn&rsquo;t happen overnight. There&rsquo;s a process you have to learn when approaching successful people. (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.rich20something.com\/connect-anyone-ultimate-guide\/\" target=\"_blank\">Here&#8217;s the exact strategy I&#8217;ve used to develop authentic relationships with influencers.<\/a>) But I worked at it, and when I was finally able to cultivate a sizable community of super-high-value people around me, I noticed something incredible: it was almost impossible to fail.<\/p>\n<p>If I had a question, doubt or fear, there was an established community of people around me who actually <em>wanted <\/em>to help me. If I didn&rsquo;t know which way to turn, there was a mentor on speed dial for almost any problem I encountered.<\/p>\n<p>Above everything else, there was a new level of expectation put on me by those I had surrounded myself with. They just expected me to be doing well, and I didn&rsquo;t want to let them down. Turns out I had the makings of an entrepreneur in me all along.<\/p>\n<p>Building that community of friends and mentors was the ultimate tool to kick my progress into warp speed, and probably the biggest reason I was able to move from a day job to self-employment so quickly.<\/p>\n<p><em>This <a href=\"http:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/245917\">article<\/a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\">Entrepreneur.com<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>More from Entrepreneur.com:<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/235216\">Here&#8217;s Why Your Envy-Inducing Facebook Feed Is All Just a Big Fat Lie (Video)<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/237831\">Richard Branson&#8217;s Guide to Finding a Mentor<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/225937\">Can You Afford to Quit Your Day Job?<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><div class=\"article-video\"><div class=\"video-wrapper brightcove-size-large\" data-pos=\"6\" data-continuous=\"1\" data-playlist=\"0\"><object id=\"bc-video-4411838984001-6\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/ti.me\/1UAQcHE\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4411838984001\"><\/object><\/div><\/div><\/span><\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Ideas","slug":"ideas","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/ideas\/","description":"TIME Ideas hosts the world's leading voices, providing commentary and expertise on the most compelling events in news, society, and culture.

<a href=\"https:\/\/www.farnamstreetblog.com\/2015\/11\/the-single-best-interview-question-you-can-ask\/\">best interview question<\/a> &mdash; what important truth do very few people agree with you on?&mdash; is tough to answer. Just think about it for a second.<\/p>\n<p>In his book <em><a class=\"external\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0804139296\/?tag=timecom-20\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero to One<\/a><\/em>, Peter Thiel argues that it might be easier to start with what everyone seems to agree on and go until you disagree.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>If you can identify a delusional popular belief, you can find what lies hidden behind it: the contrarian truth.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Consider the proposition that companies should make money for their shareholders and not lose it. This seems self-evident, but it wasn&rsquo;t so obvious to many in the late 90s. Remember back then? No loss was too big. (In my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.farnamstreetblog.com\/2015\/09\/sanjay-bakshireading-mental-models-worldly-wisdom\/\">interview with Sanjay Bakshi<\/a> he suggested that to some extent this still exists today.)<\/p>\n<p>Making money? That was old school. In the late 1990s it was all about the new economy. Eyeballs first, profits later.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Conventional beliefs only ever come to appear arbitrary and wrong in retrospect; whenever one collapses, we call the old belief a bubble. But the distortions caused by bubbles don&rsquo;t disappear when they pop. The internet craze of the &rsquo;90s was the biggest bubble since the crash of 1929, and the lessons learned afterward define and distort almost all thinking about technology today. The first step to thinking clearly is to question what we think we know about the past.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>There&rsquo;s really no need to rehash the 1990s in this article. You can google it. Or you can read the summary in chapter two of <em><a class=\"external\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0804139296\/?tag=timecom-20\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero to One<\/a><\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Where things get interesting, at least in the thinking context, are the lessons we drew from the late 90s. Thiel says the following were lessons most commonly learned:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The entrepreneurs who stuck with Silicon Valley learned four big lessons from the dot-com crash that still guide business thinking today:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Make incremental advances.<\/strong> Grand visions inflated the bubble, so they should not be indulged. Anyone who claims to be able to do something great is suspect, and anyone who wants to change the world should be more humble. Small, incremental steps are the only safe path forward.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Stay lean and flexible.<\/strong> All companies must be &ldquo;lean,&rdquo; which is code for &ldquo;unplanned.&rdquo; You should not know what your business will do; planning is arrogant and inflexible. Instead you should try things out, &ldquo;iterate,&rdquo; and treat entrepreneurship as agnostic experimentation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Improve on the competition.<\/strong> Don&rsquo;t try to create a new market prematurely. The only way to know you have a real business is to start with an already existing customer, so you should build your company by improving on recognizable products already offered by successful competitors.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Focus on product, not sales.<\/strong> If your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it&rsquo;s not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution. Bubble-era advertising was obviously wasteful, so the only sustainable growth is viral growth.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>These lessons, Thiel argues, are now <strong>dogma<\/strong> in the startup world. Ignore them at your peril and risk near certain failure. In fact, many private companies I&rsquo;ve worked with have adopted the same view. Governments too are attempting to replicate these &lsquo;facts&rsquo; &mdash; they have become conventional wisdom.<\/p>\n<p>And yet &hellip; the opposites are probably just as true if not more correct.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality.<br \/>\n2. A bad plan is better than no plan.<br \/>\n3. Competitive markets destroy profits.<br \/>\n4. Sales matters just as much as product.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Such is the world of messy social science &mdash; hard and fast rules are difficult to come by, and frequently, good ideas lose value as they gain popularity. (This is the &ldquo;everyone on their tip-toes at a parade&rdquo; <a class=\"external\" href=\"http:\/\/www.berkshirehathaway.com\/letters\/1985.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">idea<\/a>.) Just as importantly, what starts as a good hand tends to be <em>overplayed<\/em> by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.farnamstreetblog.com\/mental-models\/\">man-with-a-hammer<\/a> types.<\/p>\n<p>And so the lessons which have been culled from the tech crash are not necessarily <em>wrong<\/em>, they are just <em>context-dependent<\/em>. It is hard to generalize with them.<\/p>\n<p>According to Thiel, we must learn to use our brains <em>as well as<\/em> our genitals:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We still need new technology, and we may even need some 1999-style hubris and exuberance to get it. To build the next generation of companies, we must abandon the dogmas created after the crash. That doesn&rsquo;t mean the opposite ideas are automatically true: you can&rsquo;t escape the madness of crowds by dogmatically rejecting them. Instead ask yourself: how much of what you know about business is shaped by mistaken reactions to past mistakes? The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In a nutshell, when everyone learns the same lessons, applying them to the point of religious devotion, there can be opportunity in the opposite. If everyone is thinking the same thing, no one is really thinking.<\/p>\n<p>As Alfred Sloan, the heroic former CEO of General Motors, once put it:<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-22761\" src=\"https:\/\/s0.wp.com\/wp-content\/themes\/vip\/plugins\/lazy-load\/images\/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.farnamstreetblog.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/Alfred-Sloan.png\" alt=\"Alfred Sloan\" width=\"600\" \/><noscript><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-22761\" src=\"https:\/\/www.farnamstreetblog.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/Alfred-Sloan.png\" alt=\"Alfred Sloan\" width=\"600\" \/><\/noscript><\/p>\n<p class=\"clipper--hidden\"><em><strong>This piece originally appeared on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.farnamstreetblog.com\/2015\/12\/peter-thiel-end-of-hubris\/\" target=\"_blank\">Farnam Street<\/a>.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"clipper--hidden\"><strong>Join over 60,000 readers and get a free weekly update via email <a href=\"http:\/\/www.farnamstreetblog.com\/newsletter\/\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Ideas","slug":"ideas","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/ideas\/","description":"TIME Ideas hosts the world's leading voices, providing commentary and expertise on the most compelling events in news, society, and culture.

a disturbance in the Force. The weather is getting colder. Winter is setting in. The holiday season is soon upon us. I&rsquo;ve found that there are primarily two types of people that emerge when the holiday haze hits. Which one are you?<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The Sheep&rdquo;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>By Dec. 1, the Sheep are already mentally checked out. They might be here here physically, but their minds are roasting chestnuts over an open fire. &#8220;Dude&hellip;it&rsquo;s December,&rdquo; they&rsquo;ll tell you. The Sheep have plenty of big goals that they&rsquo;re hoping to accomplish in 2016. (I mean, who doesn&rsquo;t?) But right now, all that stuff is on the back burner. Going on mental cruise control around the holidays doesn&rsquo;t sound like such a bad idea for most people. I think we can all relate.<\/p>\n<p>But inevitably, a sinking feeling begins to develop. Right in your core.<\/p>\n<p>It starts very subtly, when you look back at 2015 goals and realize, &ldquo;Darn&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t really accomplish what I set out to do this year.&rdquo; <em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK,&rdquo; <\/em>you tell yourself. <em>&ldquo;New Year, New Me. Right? I&rsquo;ll get a fresh start in January.&rdquo; <\/em>So you set new resolutions to get even <em>more<\/em> done in 2016. It feels good to envision yourself following through.

It&rsquo;s a nice six-ish weeks of self-induced, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll deal with it after New Year&#8217;s&rdquo; bliss. But on a core level, it an agonizing cycle of self-defeat.<\/p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s how most of the population spends their holiday season. I&rsquo;ve been there, too. But there&rsquo;s another way.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. &#8220;The Hustlers&rdquo;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On the outside, Hustlers seem like anomalies whose massive success can&rsquo;t be explained with logic. They&rsquo;re like &ldquo;glitches&rdquo; in the system. These are the people who set out to accomplish <em>massive<\/em> goals every single year, and not only <em>crush<\/em> those goals but surpass them.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-4135795\"><\/div>\n<p>I know you&rsquo;ve seen them: Maybe you&rsquo;re reading <em>TIME<\/em> and catch a glimpse of some young, brilliant entrepreneur in his 20s who&rsquo;s making billions with an app he developed in his dorm room. Or perhaps it&rsquo;s the newest junior executive at your job, who despite being with the company for less time than you, has already put herself on track to become a partner.<\/p>\n<p>How are they doing it?<\/p>\n<p>The 13-Month Year is how true Hustlers get ahead. More than anything, someone living a 13-Month Year says: <em>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care that everyone else is taking the holidays off. I&rsquo;m about to turn the rocket boosters ON.&rdquo;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>While your friends and colleagues are winding down, eating a lot and singing carols, they&#8217;re grinding through the holidays. They&#8217;re starting their year early and they get an entire &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; month in 2016 to figure things out without wasting time. They&#8217;re working out all the kinks in your plans so that come Jan. 1, while everyone else is sobering up and crawling back to the office, they&#8217;re already well into the groove.<\/p>\n<p>THAT&rsquo;S how winners kill the game.<\/p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t another played out New Year&rsquo;s Resolution that you&#8217;ll sweep under the rug in a few weeks, quietly embarrassed. This is a proven strategy for success. If you want to get in better shape, maybe you&rsquo;ll use that extra month to start your workout routine and diet plan early. (You&rsquo;d be appalled how empty the gym is in December. Only Hustlers are gettin&rsquo; it in. Perfect.) <a href=\"http:\/\/rich20something.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">If you want to start a business<\/a>, maybe that extra month is used to begin testing your ideas early and identify where to focus your efforts so that you already have momentum and clarity going into 2016.<\/p>\n<p>Now here&rsquo;s the catch&#8230;. This stuff is not easy.<\/p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not a guru. I&rsquo;m just <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/Rich20Something?sub_confirmation=1\">Daniel<\/a>. I&rsquo;m not a millionaire (yet). I&rsquo;m not perfect. I&rsquo;m not all-knowing. But I have figured some stuff out that can help you. And the more I hang out with <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/Gfq0mFWmuzI\">people who are much more successful than I<\/a>, the more I realize that success is not an accident. It&rsquo;s not luck. A big part of getting ahead is the ability to focus while other people are distracted.<\/p>\n<p>So get focused now.

The press release announcing their Giving Pledge hinted that it that might be where they put some of their money, since they &#8220;are active in educational philanthropy and politics with a specific focus on charter schools.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When Mark Zuckerberg signed the Giving Pledge in 2010, he was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/mark-zuckerberg-pledges-most-of-6-billion-fortune-to-charity\/\">only worth $6 billion<\/a>. Now his net worth is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/profile\/mark-zuckerberg\/\">estimated<\/a> at $46.8 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Zuckerberg announced the birth of his daughter Max on December 1. In a Facebook <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/notes\/mark-zuckerberg\/a-letter-to-our-daughter\/10153375081581634\">post<\/a> announcing her arrival, Zuckerberg shared that he and wife Priscilla Chan plan to give away most of their wealth, rather than pass it on to Max.<\/p>\n<p>He shared the news in a letter addressed to his newborn daughter: &#8220;As you begin the next generation of the Chan Zuckerberg family, we also begin the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/chanzuckerberginitiative\/\">Chan Zuckerberg Initiative<\/a> to join people across the world to advance human potential and promote equality for all children in the next generation.

you <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rich20something.com\/dont-jealous-successful-people-become-friends\/\">make friends with successful people<\/a> the sky&#8217;s the limit. This is how partnerships are made, handshake deals are done, and new audiences found. And it&#8217;s not as difficult as you might think.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest reason why connecting with people benefits you is simple: It allows you to extend your reach further, which in turn allows your ideas to make a much bigger impact.<\/p>\n<p>The result is that you achieve your goals a lot faster with a few key friends to help you out than if it is just you, banging your head against the wall.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, the more successful people you&#8217;re connected to, <a href=\"http:\/\/lifehacker.com\/5926309\/how-the-people-around-you-affect-personal-success\" target=\"_hplink\">the more likely you are to be successful yourself<\/a> (&#8220;You&#8217;re the average of your five closest friends&#8221;).<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s just a good idea to get close to as many winners as possible. But this is the part where most of us throw up our hands:<\/p>\n<p><em>Duh. Connect with successful people. But how?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Today, I&#8217;m going to teach you how to connect with <em>anybody<\/em> in the world.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Networking? Yuck.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think the term is &#8220;played out&#8221; at best. At worst, it&#8217;s completely repulsive.<\/p>\n<p>Nobody wants to think of themselves as a &#8220;networker,&#8221; nobody likes to think of themselves as part of someone else&#8217;s &#8220;network,&#8221; and without question nobody enjoys &#8220;networking&#8221; mixers.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s something predatory about the whole experience.<\/p>\n<p>So from here on out, we&#8217;ll frame our conversation in the context of meeting and connecting with interesting people for the simple joy of making new friends and living a better life. We&#8217;re not collecting people or trading &#8220;contacts.&#8221; We&#8217;re not dealing with baseball cards.<\/p>\n<p>These are real people (just as we are) and if you think of everyone as a human, not a potential step in your ego-driven ladder-climbing to success, I guarantee you that you will actually climb said ladder faster.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s counterintuitive, but it works. I promise.<\/p>\n<div class=\"article-video\"><div class=\"video-wrapper brightcove-size-large\" data-pos=\"24\" data-continuous=\"1\" data-playlist=\"0\"><object id=\"bc-video-4105230971001-24\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/ti.me\/1PYOfG3\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4105230971001\"><\/object><\/div><\/div>\n<p><strong>Step 1: The Internet cocktail party &mdash; how to find people with mutual interests and make them love you<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Do you ever suspect successful people all know each other? Like an elite secret society?<\/p>\n<p>Well, you&#8217;re partially right. But you can get an invite to the club (meetings are in a basement in Southeastern Utah, by the way).<\/p>\n<p>When I first started my blog <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rich20something.com\/blog\/\">Rich20Something<\/a>, I didn&#8217;t know anybody. It was like walking into a cocktail party by myself where everyone was already acquainted, and not knowing a single soul.<\/p>\n<p>In that situation, the only logical thing you can do is start introducing yourself to people in a way that prompts them to respond to you.<\/p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t want to be the only one babysitting a drink in the corner, do you?<\/p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t have much to give at the time, but I did have my little website. So I decided to conduct interviews. Why interviews? Well, let&#8217;s face it: Everyone likes to talk about themselves &mdash; and anyone who&#8217;s been around the Internet block a few times knows that having your name in as many places as possible is helpful. It all adds up.<\/p>\n<p>So I just searched on Twitter, Facebook, etcetera to find people with sizable audiences who seemed like they had something interesting to say. I wrote literally <em>dozens<\/em> of emails to different bloggers and entrepreneurs asking the simple question, &#8220;Can I interview you?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Looking back on it, my approach was juvenile and ugly. But it got the job done. I&#8217;ll remind you over and over again, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/246399\">it&#8217;s more important to just do it than to get it 100 perfect right.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>I personalized each message, pressed send, and prayed. Soon I started getting actual responses&#8211;mind blown. Then I created a page of interviews &#8212; which ended up being the first page of this website. In one fell swoop I&#8217;d created some cool content for my readers (which at that point, was basically just my mom) and I&#8217;d made some connections.<\/p>\n<p>People began to know who I am. I was no longer a complete stranger at the party.<\/p>\n<p>If I were doing this entire exercise over again, I would keep it super short and distill the information into only the essential points. Most people aren&#8217;t jerks &#8211; so they&#8217;d like to be able to read your stuff.<\/p>\n<p>But <em>everyone<\/em> is busy and overwhelmed. So make it easy on them. Use this template:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Hey (name), My name is Daniel and I do ________ (insert job, blog, etc). I saw your work on _______ and really enjoyed it. I&#8217;m just reaching out because __________ (insert common interest, solution to their problem, etc). Do you have 5 minutes to chat any time in the next 2 weeks? I have some time on __________ (name a few specific days\/times) Thanks! Daniel<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>If you do this 100 times and make 10 new friends, that alone is completely worth the effort. However, as you practice more and more, you&#8217;ll start refining your process and most likely, your response rates will increase.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-4131216\"><\/div>\n<p>I got to a point where nine of 10 people were responding to me. That&#8217;s when I knew I was onto something.<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;What if I don&#8217;t have a blog?&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Get one! <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rich20something.com\/want-build-audience-dont-start-blog-instead\/\" target=\"_hplink\">Building an audience<\/a> is one of the most powerful things you can do with your time.<\/p>\n<p>But if you&#8217;re not there yet, you need to find something that adds <em>value<\/em> to the person&#8217;s life.<\/p>\n<p>Do some research to find out some of their passions, hobbies or pain points, then send them related content. Are they looking for the solution to a particular problem that you can help them with? (<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Hint<\/span>: following them on Twitter often reveals those little annoyances that you can fix. Twitter is where people go to complain.)<\/p>\n<p>Basically, be interesting and relevant. It&#8217;s not as hard as it sounds to find common interests, connections or ways to help someone.<\/p>\n<p><em>Something to remember: <\/em>You have to choose the <em>right<\/em> time to reach out to someone. Just because you got your hands on the email address of a New York <em>Times<\/em> bestselling author doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s the right time to connect with them.<\/p>\n<p>Do your research. I&#8217;ll frequently get the contact information of people I&#8217;d like to connect with but hold off on getting in touch. It&#8217;s not the right time if I know when we talk, I won&#8217;t have anything particularly interesting to say.<\/p>\n<p>Again, we&#8217;re not just collecting people here, we&#8217;re making friends. <em>Be a good friend.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Ride the value wave<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I almost hate using the world &#8220;value&#8221; so many times, but it does a pretty good job of describing what you should be giving to your new friends. &#8220;Value&#8221; can mean many things &mdash; from a physical gift, to an important connection, to simply a warm feeling.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s always something to contribute.<\/p>\n<p>That being said, now that you&#8217;ve started that friendship, it&#8217;s time to give, give, give. Really start digging deep and think about how you can be of service to people. But the key is to think of the relationship as a &#8220;long game.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I want you to completely forget about what the other person can do for you. At least for now. For the time being, it&#8217;s all about them.<\/p>\n<p>Many people, myself included, make the mistake of thinking that as soon as you&#8217;ve made a connection with someone and offered a sliver of value, you can immediately extract value from them by asking for a favor, connection, etc.<\/p>\n<p><em>So wrong!<\/em> In fact, think of this whole value process as depositing money into a savings account. All the things you do for the other person is the principal. That&#8217;s not to be touched.<\/p>\n<p>You can only start &#8220;withdrawing&#8221; value from the relationship once you&#8217;ve contributed enough to generate some interest. Trust me, I learned this the hard way &#8211; often bumping my head and wondering why &#8211; as I asked important people I&#8217;d <em>just<\/em> met to immediately do something for me that was equal or greater value to what I&#8217;d just done for them.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t be <em>that<\/em> guy (or gal).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><div class=\"article-video\"><div class=\"video-wrapper brightcove-size-large\" data-pos=\"25\" data-continuous=\"1\" data-playlist=\"0\"><object id=\"bc-video-4443572678001-25\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/ti.me\/1PYOfG3\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4443572678001\"><\/object><\/div><\/div><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Reap the rewards of real friendships<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now that you&#8217;ve become friends with and demonstrated your value to whatever organization\/blogger\/entrepreneur, you are officially part of the team.

With the support of organizations I believed in and media outlets I subscribed to, I asked my new friends if they&#8217;d be interested in doing a guest post on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rich20something.com\/blog\/\">Rich20Something.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Does this entire process take a lot of energy?<\/p>\n<p><em>Yes.<\/em> But the rewards are quite literally <em>priceless<\/em>. It&#8217;s not about connecting with <em>specific<\/em> people. It&#8217;s about the <em>process<\/em> of identifying individuals you want to meet, becoming great friends with them, and seeing where things go.<\/p>\n<p><em>Now imagine doing this for decades<\/em>. You could go anywhere you want, have access to almost anything you desire and know that in an instant, you&#8217;d have the resources to solve your toughest problems.

1997, and Steve Jobs has just returned to the company he was fired from 12 years before.<\/p>\n<p>On stage at Apple&#8217;s World Wide Developers Conference, Jobs was holding a rare Q&amp;A with developers when one audience member stood up and lobbed an insult at Jobs.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Mr. Jobs, you&#8217;re a bright and influential man,&#8221; he starts out with a flat tone. The audience laughs in the pause.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Here it comes,&#8221; Job responds with a smile.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s sad and clear that on several counts you&#8217;ve discussed, you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. [Audience laughter]. I would like, for example, for you to express in clear terms how, say, Java and any of its incarnations addresses the ideas embodied in OpenDoc. And when you&#8217;re finished with that, perhaps you can tell us what you personally have been doing for the last seven years,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>At that point, the audience fell quiet and someone is heard saying &#8220;Ouch.&#8221; (Jobs had spent the last seven years not at Apple.)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><div class=\"article-video\"><div class=\"video-wrapper brightcove-size-large\" data-pos=\"28\" data-continuous=\"1\" data-playlist=\"0\"><object id=\"bc-video-4443572678001-28\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/ti.me\/1PMOkwc\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4443572678001\"><\/object><\/div><\/div><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Mistakes will be made&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Jobs&#8217; response in the five minutes that follows is a masterclass in how to gracefully turn an insult into an impromptu speech on vision.<\/p>\n<p>First, Jobs politely responds.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You know, you can please some of the people some of the time, but&hellip;,&#8221; Jobs paused. &#8220;One of the hardest things when you&rsquo;re trying to effect change is that people like this gentleman are right in some areas.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He acknowledges that there are things OpenDoc does that he&#8217;s not even familiar with, but that doesn&#8217;t stop him in planning Apple&#8217;s future.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The hardest thing is: how does that fit in to a cohesive, larger vision, that&rsquo;s going to allow you to sell 8 billion dollars, 10 billion dollars of product a year? And, one of the things I&rsquo;ve always found is that you&rsquo;ve got to start with the customer experience and work backwards for the technology.&rdquo; You can&rsquo;t start with the technology and try to figure out where you&rsquo;re going to try to sell it. And I made this mistake probably more than anybody else in this room. And I got the scar tissue to prove it. And I know that it&rsquo;s the case,&#8221; Jobs said.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-4126440\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;And as we have tried to come up with a strategy and a vision for Apple, it started with &#8216;What incredible benefits can we give to the customer? Where can we take the customer?&#8217; Not starting with &#8216;Let&rsquo;s sit down with the engineers and figure out what awesome technology we have and then how are we going to market that?&#8217; And I think that&rsquo;s the right path to take,&#8221; Jobs continued.<\/p>\n<p>He apologizes for killing off some of the software, but passionately stands by his employees who were working hard to get Apple back to the place where he could hold up a box and people would go &#8220;Whoa! Yes!&#8221; and want it. (Think about what Apple events are like today.)<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Mistakes will be made, some people will be pissed off, some people will not know what they&rsquo;re talking about, but I think it&rsquo;s so much better than where things were not very long ago. And I think we&rsquo;re going to get there,&#8221; Jobs concludes.<\/p>\n<div class=\"article-video\">\n<div class=\"time-embed time-embed__youtube video-wrapper\" data-provider=\"youtube\"

it&#8217;s going to the gym, reading the paper, or enjoying a cup of coffee, most of us have things in our morning routine that we rarely skip.<\/p>\n<p>Getting into a good morning routine can help us be more productive throughout the day. The consistency can also be comforting.<\/p>\n<p>With the help of this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sleepypeople.com\/blog\/how-successful-people-start-their-day\">great infographic from sleepypeople.com<\/a>, we decided to look at the morning routines of some of the world&#8217;s most successful business people and politicians.<\/p>\n<p><strong>U.S. President Barack Obama hits the gym <em>every<\/em> morning<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The President of the United States and arguably the world&rsquo;s most powerful man, Obama isn&rsquo;t one to hang around in the mornings.<\/p>\n<p>Sleepypeople.com tells us that the president is up by 6:45 a.m. every morning. Then, he goes to gym to do both weights and cardio.<\/p>\n<p>Once he&rsquo;s finished pumping iron, Obama will head back to eat breakfast with his wife Michelle, and his two daughters Malia and Sasha, before sending the girls off to school.<\/p>\n<p>After the kids are gone, it&#8217;s time to get down to the serious business of running the country.<\/p>\n<p><strong>British Prime Minister David Cameron avoids watching TV in the morning<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=z9hqE5HVVQk\">a video from the Sun<\/a> showed that British Prime Minister David Cameron starts his day at 6:00 a.m, and will go through important government business until around 8:00 a.m, when he joins his wife Samantha, and kids Arthur, Nancy, and Florence for a bite of breakfast.<\/p>\n<p>Cameron&rsquo;s private flat in No.10 Downing Street has a strict no TV rule in the mornings, and in the past the Prime Minister has said that he thinks his children should be &ldquo;doing something&rdquo; in the morning before school.<\/p>\n<p>Cameron is also an avid follower of media coverage and will take time to catch up on the news every morning.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div class=\"article-video\"><div class=\"video-wrapper brightcove-size-large\" data-pos=\"36\" data-continuous=\"1\" data-playlist=\"0\"><object id=\"bc-video-115568863001-36\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/ti.me\/1kLmPGE\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"115568863001\"><\/object><\/div><\/div><\/p>\n<p><strong>Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill wasn&#8217;t really a morning person<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Another Conservative Prime Minister of Britain, albeit of a slightly different era. According to sleepypeople.com, Churchill woke up at 7:30 a.m. every morning. Pretty normal right?
