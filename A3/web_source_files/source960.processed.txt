I started a business to avoid maternity leave

   Does the thought of juggling a career and a family fill you with fear?
   For Hana Dickinson, the solution was to rebuild her working life from
   scratch

   I always knew that I wanted to have a child, but being a mum was never
   my vocation. A career in marketing was my focus from the moment I left
   university. I loved it, threw myself into it completely and built a
   life around it.

   The thing is, I had left no room in my life for the child that I knew I
   wanted. After I got married, this persistent niggle grew into a real
   issue and I needed to work out a solution. I found it difficult to see
   past the seemingly insurmountable level of compromise and change needed
   to shoehorn a child into my wonderful life. I really couldn’t see how
   it would be possible.

   I dreaded the idea of maternity leave: to be isolated in a flat in east
   London, alone with a baby while others lived my life, did my job,
   impressed my boss and forgot about me. It felt as if I would be shipped
   off to deal with this big life change alone, while everyone –
   everything – I had come to rely on faded into the distance.

     I need this balance to be happy: I would have really struggled with
     the isolation of maternity leave.

   I wrestled with the thought of going back to work and no longer being
   able to do the 10 to 12 hour days, out-of-hours networking, and
   conferences away. I knew I would be one of the ones who had to dash off
   early to pick the kids up, while my colleagues stayed behind to finish
   the job. That didn’t sit comfortably with me, but equally I wasn’t
   prepared to let someone else be there for my child while I stubbornly
   stuck to my mantra of working harder and longer than everyone else

   I realised that I had to find my own way; my own balance. I needed to
   rearrange the blocks to build something that would allow me to continue
   to do what I love whilst raising a child.

   To cut a long story short, the compromise was London. I quit my job,
   sold my flat and moved back to Suffolk to start a marketing agency.
   This gave me a job in marketing, a big new challenge and the optional
   privacy and flexibility to eventually attempt to be a mother and keep
   working.

   As the business grew, it attracted the interest of my mum – a retired
   sales and marketing director and my mentor and confidante. She offered
   to help out and thankfully liked it enough to stay. Between us we
   coaxed my father (also a seasoned marketing pro) to join us. With
   strength in numbers, thrice the number of contacts and an array of
   complementary skills, we gradually built up a great little business.

   misconceptions

   After two years, with the business in safe hands, I took the next leap
   of faith and became pregnant.

   The environment I had created allowed me to work right up to my
   daughter’s birth, wearing Ugg boots as my feet were so swollen. I took
   two weeks off when she was born and then worked from home when she
   slept. Thankfully she was a really good sleeper: a major factor in the
   success of my plan. I couldn’t do as much as I had before but I worked
   every day, continued running the business and remained involved with
   all of our clients. It wasn’t easy but it was what I needed.

   After nine months, I gradually introduced her to nursery and now, at
   two years old, she goes four days a week. It works for us. I give the
   business my full attention for those four days and after bedtime. I
   pick my daughter up every day and get her ready for bed. We have
   Wednesdays all to ourselves for activities and outings. When I’m with
   her she gets my full attention. I need this balance to be happy: I
   would have struggled with the isolation of maternity leave and the
   challenges of going back into my old job with new priorities.

   The business is hard work, challenging, stressful and rewarding – just
   like my old job – but also nothing like my old job. I have a confident,
   cheerful daughter and I am a cheerful, confident person. I’m thankful
   that I didn’t have to go into maternity quarantine.
