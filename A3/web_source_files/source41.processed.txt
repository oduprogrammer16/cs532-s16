   This story has been updated.

   The roll out of President Obama’s health care reform package was always
   going to be tricky, with vehement opposition from his political
   opponents and pushback from employers large and small. But after
   announcing last week that penalties for companies failing to comply
   with the law [91]will be delayed by a year, the Affordable Care Act has
   a new, high profile set of dissenters: Unions.

   The leaders of three major U.S. unions, including the highly
   influential Teamsters, have sent a scathing letter to Democratic
   leaders in Congress, warning that unless changes are made, President
   Obama’s health care reform plan will “destroy the foundation of the 40
   hour work week that is the backbone of the American middle class.”

   If that’s not bad enough, the Affordable Care Act, if not modified,
   will “destroy the very health and wellbeing of our members along with
   millions of other hardworking Americans,” the letter says.

   The full letter, below:

   ———————-

   Dear Leader Reid and Leader Pelosi:

   When you and the President sought our support for the Affordable Care
   Act (ACA), you pledged that if we liked the health plans we have now,
   we could keep them. Sadly, that promise is under threat. Right now,
   unless you and the Obama Administration enact an equitable fix, the ACA
   will shatter not only our hard-earned health benefits, but destroy the
   foundation of the 40 hour work week that is the backbone of the
   American middle class.

   Like millions of other Americans, our members are front-line workers in
   the American economy. We have been strong supporters of the notion that
   all Americans should have access to quality, affordable health care. We
   have also been strong supporters of you. In campaign after campaign we
   have put boots on the ground, gone door-to-door to get out the vote,
   run phone banks and raised money to secure this vision.

   Now this vision has come back to haunt us.

   Since the ACA was enacted, we have been bringing our deep concerns to
   the Administration, seeking reasonable regulatory interpretations to
   the statute that would help prevent the destruction of non-profit
   health plans. As you both know first-hand, our persuasive arguments
   have been disregarded and met with a stone wall by the White House and
   the pertinent agencies. This is especially stinging because other
   stakeholders have repeatedly received successful interpretations for
   their respective grievances. Most disconcerting of course is last
   week’s huge accommodation for the employer community—extending the
   statutorily mandated “December 31, 2013” deadline for the employer
   mandate and penalties.

   Time is running out: Congress wrote this law; we voted for you. We have
   a problem; you need to fix it. The unintended consequences of the ACA
   are severe. Perverse incentives are already creating nightmare
   scenarios:

   First, the law creates an incentive for employers to keep employees’
   work hours below 30 hours a week. Numerous employers have begun to cut
   workers’ hours to avoid this obligation, and many of them are doing so
   openly. The impact is two-fold: fewer hours means less pay while also
   losing our current health benefits.
   Second, millions of Americans are covered by non-profit health
   insurance plans like the ones in which most of our members participate.
   These non-profit plans are governed jointly by unions and companies
   under the Taft-Hartley Act. Our health plans have been built over
   decades by working men and women. Under the ACA as interpreted by the
   Administration, our employees will treated differently and not be
   eligible for subsidies afforded other citizens. As such, many employees
   will be relegated to second-class status and shut out of the help the
   law offers to for-profit insurance plans.

   And finally, even though non-profit plans like ours won’t receive the
   same subsidies as for-profit plans, they’ll be taxed to pay for those
   subsidies. Taken together, these restrictions will make non-profit
   plans like ours unsustainable, and will undermine the health-care
   market of viable alternatives to the big health insurance companies.

   On behalf of the millions of working men and women we represent and the
   families they support, we can no longer stand silent in the face of
   elements of the Affordable Care Act that will destroy the very health
   and wellbeing of our members along with millions of other hardworking
   Americans.

   We believe that there are common-sense corrections that can be made
   within the existing statute that will allow our members to continue to
   keep their current health plans and benefits just as you and the
   President pledged. Unless changes are made, however, that promise is
   hollow.

   We continue to stand behind real health care reform, but the law as it
   stands will hurt millions of Americans including the members of our
   respective unions.

   We are looking to you to make sure these changes are made.
