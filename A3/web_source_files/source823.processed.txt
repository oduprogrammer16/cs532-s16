   A junior doctor accused Jeremy Hunt of "spin", "manipulation" and
   "lies" in a damning interview discussing the ongoing battle between the
   government and those on the frontline of the NHS.

   Rachel Clarke was talking in response to comments the Health Secretary
   made on the Andrew Marr show on Sunday morning in which he blamed the
   BMA for strike action.

   [217]Hunt was left looking decidedly uncomfortable when Andrew Marr
   read him a selection of remarks from junior doctors on the front line
   of the NHS.

   IFRAME: [218]https://www.youtube.com/embed/LvpOL1tsjtk

   Quoting one, Marr said: "The profession is at absolute breaking point.
   I see doctors in tears because they are so despairing over what the
   future holds. Jeremy Hunt has done this. He's driving away a whole
   generation of doctors."

   The health secretary deflected the criticism by blaming the British
   Medical Association, calling them "irresponsible" for "spreading
   misinformation".

   Hunt answered: "It's incredibly disappointing, the totally
   irresponsible way the BMA has behaved in refusing to sit down and talk
   about how we can improve patient care and spreading misinformation."

   He added: "One of the reasons for that anger is they were told by the
   BMA their pay was going to be cut, it isn't. They were told they were
   going to have to work longer hours, they aren't...

   "If you're told by your union that the health secretary wants to do
   these awful things, of course you're going to feel devalued."

   Later on Sunday one of the junior doctors quoted earlier, Rachel
   Clarke, appeared on BBC News to respond.

   She said: "It's extraordinary for me as a frontline junior doctor to
   hear my health secretary say that. I would like to believe that if her
   were actually committed to patient safety he would actually take
   seriously the concerns from the frontline of doctors like me.

   "Instead there he seems to have used my concerns to have scored an
   opportunity to score cheap political points at the expense of the BMA.

   "He says he cares about junior doctor morale but I can tell you now
   that the single biggest problem for my morale, the thing that is making
   me want to quit my profession at the moment, is not the BMA, what I
   hear from the union or what I read in the media, it is what he, my
   health secretary says.

   "He spins against us, he manipulates statistics against us and quite
   frankly he lies."

   One of the main areas for disagreement is how doctors are paid for
   working unsociable hours, particularly on Saturdays.

   The government has tried to claim an increase in deaths at weekends is
   due to lack of staff, which others have disputed, saying there is not
   the data to support this.

   Hunt told Marr: "Health secretaries have these battles but what history
   judges in the end is, have you done the right thing for patients?"

   Dr Johann Malawana, the BMA junior doctor committee chair, said the
   strike had been "wholly avoidable" and was caused by Hunt's "shambolic
   mishandling" of the matter.

   "[Hunt] risks alienating a generation of junior doctors and undermining
   the delivery of future patient care, which is why 98% of those junior
   doctors who voted, supported taking industrial action," he added.

   “The BMA has been clear throughout this process that we want to reach a
   negotiated agreement – no doctor wants to take industrial action, and
   our door has always been open to talks.

   "But the government is putting politics before reason, and their
   continued threat to impose a contract that junior doctors have roundly
   rejected leaves us with no option.

   “Junior doctors already work around the clock, seven days a week and
   they do so under their existing contract.

   "If the government want more seven-day services then, quite simply,
   they need more doctors, nurses and diagnostic staff, and the extra
   investment needed to deliver it."

       Who are junior doctors?
       [slide_458290_6172684_free.jpg] Stuart Gleave via Getty Images
       Junior doctors are those doctors who have graduated from medical
       school but who are yet to qualify as either a consultant or general
       practitioner.
       Doctors are required to undertake five years of medical training
       and to graduate from accredited schools [219]before entering what's
       known as a foundation period.
       They are then required to work as [220]juniors after the foundation
       period before ascending to consultant or GP status. This means many
       doctors do not fully qualify until well into their 30s.

       Why are their contracts changing?
       [slide_458290_6172686_free.jpg] Stuart Gleave via Getty Images
       Demands upon the [221]NHS are increasing, and at the same time, the
       government wants to move towards a seven-day, out-of-hours health
       service.
       Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt says planned contract changes will
       make healthcare more flexible, and more able to adapt to changing
       levels of demand.
       [222]He has denied the charge that the contracts are specifically
       designed to lower the wage bill of doctors who'll be forced to work
       'out of hours' for no extra pay.

       Why are people unhappy?
       [slide_458290_6172688_free.jpg] Stuart Gleave via Getty Images
       Junior doctors [223]are unhappy at the proposed contract's
       potential effect on safe working hours.
       They say that introducing new shift patterns and broadening normal
       working days to include hours up to 10pm may have the effect of
       increasing tiredness amongst medics.
       The new contracts may impinge on doctors' work-life balance, reduce
       time spent with their families, [224]and may increase work-related
       stress. These may affect patient care, some argue.
       Dr Shebby Kamalvand [225]wrote of the hypocrisy of the proposals -
       the implication that doctors are worth less than they are paid now,
       but are required to work more flexibly to cope with increased
       demand.
       The proposals [226]may also make things less fair for those working
       less than full time and taking parental leave.
       But most of all, the British Medical Association believes the
       threat of imposition to be entirely unacceptable [227]-- a
       stumbling block so large it has halted negotiations entirely.
     * 4
       What do they want?
       [slide_458290_6172770_free.jpg] Stuart Gleave via Getty Images
       According to the [228]British Medical Association, which represents
       junior doctors in negotiations, they want:

     "The BMA wants the following concrete assurances in writing from the
     Government before we can agree to re-enter negotiations:
     - Proper recognition of unsocial hours as premium time - No
     disadvantage for those working unsocial hours compared to current
     system - No disadvantage for those working less than full time and
     taking parental leave compared to the current system - Pay for all
     work done - Proper hours safeguards protecting patients and their
     doctors
     The contract proposed by the Government rides roughshod over the
     best interests of doctors, of patients and of the NHS as a whole.
     Junior doctors have made it clear that they are not prepared to
     accept a contract that is unfair and unsafe."
     * 5
       Will they get it?
       [slide_458290_6173456_free.jpg] Stuart Gleave via Getty Images
       Negotiations are currently at an impasse, with both NHS Employers,
       which acts on behalf of government, and representatives of junior
       doctors refusing to budge on the threat of imposition.
       A staged introduction of the new changes could take effect whereby
       those joining the profession are subject to the new conditions.
       However, this may do little to tackle [229]the dire recruitment and
       retention of junior doctors after the foundation period.
       Jeremy Hunt is likely to move forward in a way which brings junior
       doctors back around the negotiating table.

       And what if they don't?
       [slide_458290_6173556_free.jpg] shutterstock
       But there are signs of what will happen should Mr Hunt refuse to
       yield to doctors' demands.
       Members of his own party have highlighted cases of doctors
       emigrating from the UK to work as doctors elsewhere. Dr Sarah
       Wollaston, now a Tory MP and chair of the Commons Health Select
       Committee, says that her own daughter and eight of her doctor
       friends have left the UK for Australia.
       And it doesn't look like they'll be alone in leaving Britain. The
       [230]General Medical Council has received more applications for a
       Certificate of Currently Professional Status so far this year as it
       did in the whole of 2014. The Certificate is needed if doctors wish
       to practice medicine abroad.
       In 2014, the GMC issued 4925 certificates. So far this year it has
       issued 7468, its latest figures reveal.
