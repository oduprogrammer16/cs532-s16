     * [70]Measuring Your Plan with a Tabletop Exercise Measuring Your
       Plan with a Tabletop Exercise Tony Kirtley, Senior Incident
       Response Consultant at Dell SecureWorks

   BrightTALK Recorded: Feb 16 2016
   56 mins
   Ensuring your CIRP is a plan for disaster – not a disaster waiting to
   happen.
   Most organizations establish Cybersecurity Incident Response Plans
   (CIRP) with great intentions of leveraging them during security
   breaches. The reality is, many times once a CIRP is established it gets
   filed away to collect dust on a shelf until a breach occurs, leaving it
   out of date and out of mind. If a breach occurred tomorrow, would your
   organization know the proper steps and procedures to eradicate the
   threat... who the key stake holders are and the communications flow...
   when and how to reach out to a third-party for support?
   All of these are included as a part of your CIRP, but using a dusty
   CIRP as a guide for the first time during a breach is not a plan – it’s
   a disaster waiting to happen. Testing your plan prior to an incident is
   the key to minimize the duration, impact and cost of a breach to your
   organization.
   During this interactive webinar, Tony Kirtley, Senior Incident Response
   Consultant at Dell SecureWorks, will share the importance of testing
   your CIRP plan through regular tabletop exercises to help identify your
   organization's strengths and weaknesses, and further the development of
   your proactive security capabilities.
   In addition you will learn:
   - What makes an effective tabletop exercise?
   - Real stories of how organizations benefited from tabletop exercises.
   - The benefit of bringing in an objective third party to facilitate
   your table top exercise.

   and Holding: Deciding When to Launch Your Defenses Jeffrey Ritter,
   External Lecturer, University of Oxford

   BrightTALK Recorded: Feb 16 2016 41 mins

   Security demands countless decisions to determine whether or not log
   data or other surveillance data are positive indicators of adverse
   activity or merely false positives. Knowing when, and how, to make and
   document those decisions can be critical to how legal and compliance
   sanctions may be imposed. Designing your security controls to do so
   effectively can make all of the difference. Learn how rules-based
   design can transform your design frameworks and keep lawyers and
   regulators away.

   [97]Using Targeted Intelligence to Direct Your Technology Policy Using
   Targeted Intelligence to Direct Your Technology Policy Jules Pagna
   Disso, Head of Research and Development, Nettitude

   BrightTALK Recorded: Feb 16 2016 49 mins

   The success of cyber threat intelligence is measured by its
   effectiveness in reducing the impact of malicious actors. It is
   therefore important to understand the economy of malware in order to
   break the chains of success of such economy. Such success needs to be
   materialised by a change in attitude, policies and configurations.
   Whilst applicable to most organisations, most examples used during this
   seminar will feature the financial sector and aim to:
   · Analyse the core components of the economy of malware
   · Analyse how to gather intelligence to reduce the impact of malicious
   actors
   · Show how to use the intelligence gathered to improve the security
   posture of the organisation

     * [103]Automated Translation Management for Product Information
       Management -Product 360 Mar 22 2016 9:00 am UTC 45 mins
       Sören Berger, Senior Business Consultant, parsionate GmbH, Jost
       Gödecke, Principal Technical Consultant, parsionate GmbH
       In a globalized world it is no longer sufficient to produce product
       data only in the native language. Therefore, a professional
       translation is a must to approach customers.
       Translation done by external agencies is a cost driver. Reducing
       these costs is not only a technical challenge but also may result
       in procedural changes in the teams as well as in changes to the
       established workflows.
       Watch this webinar to learn about the challenges of automated
       translation management: How can the cooperation of several internal
       and external involved persons be organized in an effective way and
       how can these processes be implemented into a Software?
       In the second part of this webinar you will get a first impression
       on how to solve the challenges coming up with the integration: A
       demonstration of a real implementation project, connecting one of
       the leading TMS-solutions with Informatica MDM - Product 360,
       provides you insights into the technical realization of automated
       translation management.

       Erik Jarlstrom, Informatica, David Loshin, TDWI
       Data Security Intelligence is new, but data security and management
       are not. Most organizations have already deployed some type of data
       security solution(s) and data management solutions and so it is
       logical to ask how DSI relates to these. How does DSI complement
       these diverse but related environments? This webinar will answer
       these critical questions.

       Feb 23 2016 6:00 pm UTC 60 mins
       Noel Yuhanna, Principal Analyst, Forrester Research
       With growing adoption of technologies like Hadoop, new sources of
       data are being ingested into the organization with hopes of
       developing more compelling reports, predictions, and actions. But
       data analysts are held back from creating useful insights because
       they are forced to manually find and reconcile siloed and
       inconsistent data across the organization. Analytics end up filled
       with inaccuracies stemming from data that is incomplete,
       inconsistent, and insecure. Organizations are turning to big data
       fabric reference architectures to automatically and intelligently
       bring together disparate big data sources, processing them in a big
       data platform technology, such as Hadoop, and finally deliver a
       unified, trusted, and comprehensive view of the business.
       Join Noel Yuhanna, Principal Analyst of Forrester Research, on this
       webinar to learn about new opportunities for your organization,
       including:
       •How to deliver trusted insights more quickly for your business

       23 2016 2:00 pm UTC 60 mins
       Paul Garstang, Steve Holyer, Rob Boden
       Perhaps one of the greatest challenges we currently face in terms
       of securing our customer and corporate sensitive data, is actually
       developing the capability to track its movement through our
       organization, and understanding who and how the data is being used.
       This is becoming a major focus for Audit teams right now, as how
       can we demonstrate that we have effective security controls in
       place, if we don’t have any mechanism for tracing where the
       sensitive data is residing, or how it is moving through our IT
       Landscape.
       In this discussion and demonstration we will take a look at how
       Informatica’s Secure@Source is breaking new ground, as the first
       effective Data Security Intelligence tool in this space. Providing
       clients know with real time consolidated dashboards, which capture
       and display the proliferation, security and usage profile of all
       the sensitive data held, across hundreds of corporate data stores.
       The webinar will be hosted by Paul Garstang, Steve Holyer and
       Robert Boden, from Informatica’s Data Security Technology Group.

       Justin Donlon, BI Architect, Carbonite; Mike McDermott, SVP,
       Primitive Logic; Clive Bearman, Product Marketing, Informatica
       Your customers deserve great service, but nothing destroys goodwill
       more than long wait times, unanswered questions and being treated
       like a number. So how can you deploy CRM to fix these issues and
       keep delighting your best customers?
       Salesforce is undoubtedly one of your most crucial CRM investments
       and one of today's most powerful cloud ecosystems — but poor
       deployment choices and massive app proliferation can introduce
       integration complexity that can dramatically impact the Salesforce
       data and ultimately drive down customer satisfaction scores. Join
       Clive Bearman, Director of Product Marketing at Informatica, Justin
       Donlon, Business Intelligence Solution Architect at Carbonite, and
       Mike McDermott, SVP of Business Development at Primitive Logic, as
       they discuss how to best tame the data integration complexity and
       amp your customer service.
       Clive will discuss connectivity and integration scenarios across
       the Salesforce portfolio, not just Sales Cloud. Justin will explain
       how Carbonite attained an independent 9.5 out of 10 satisfaction
       score. Mike will conclude with practical implementation advice to
       enable you to deepen your relationships with your customers
       At the end of the webinar, you’ll understand where and when to use
       the most appropriate techniques, and how to score quick wins for
       better customer service.

       Josh Alpern, Informatica, Saeed Kahn, Informatica, Robert Shields,
       Informatica
       Informatica PowerCenter is designed to deliver end-to-end data
       integration agility. A big part of agility is about delivering data
       integration testing, rapidly, reliably and securely.
       Testing is a crucial, often overlooked, element of your development
       lifecycle. Today, data integration testing is often time-consuming,
       manual, script driven, painful and error-prone. Validating your
       data as part of Unit and Regression Testing may be manual,
       unreliable and lacking reusability and auditablity. Provisioning
       the right test data sets in dev/test environment may delay the
       process and result in inaccurate test outcomes. Sensitive data may
       not be protected during testing.
       In this webinar we will discuss capabilities that will automate
       your data integration testing so you can quickly, reliably and
       securely move your applications into production:
       •PowerCenter Data Validation testing to validate your logic in unit
       and regression testing
       •Automated management, provisioning and generation of the optimal
       test data sets in non-production environments
       •Consistent masking to ensure sensitive data is protected in
       dev/test environments, while ensuring high quality, realistic test
       data is maintained
       Join us to learn how you can improve your data integration testing
       to accelerate your development lifecycle, deliver better quality
       data in production and protect sensitive data during testing.

     * [135]A 360° Customer View for Telecoms: Driving Value from Data
       Recorded: Jan 27 2016 60 mins
       Mark Hiseman, Informatica; Stephan Zoder, Informatica; Vishal
       Saxena, Tech Mahindra
       One of the most critical assets for a telecommunications service
       provider is their data. As ever-increasing customer, product and
       network data volumes pour through the organizational networks
       worldwide, it becomes more difficult to maintain, control and
       derive value out of them.
       Some challenges include:
       • Inaccurate customer records and reporting
       • Duplicate product information and mismatched assets
       • Rising customer dissatisfaction due to call center inefficiencies
       These challenges not only cause system inefficiencies, but also
       have an impact on the revenue and bottom-line for the provider.
       Join our speakers to understand how these challenges can be
       overcome and how the data can be created, maintained and analyzed
       to enhance its value through master data management (MDM).
       Tech Mahindra has built an accelerator using Informatica’s
       market-leading multi-domain MDM solution and we will demonstrate
       the system to show how telecoms can ensure that the consistency,
       accuracy, stewardship and accountability of data is kept intact
       across the organization.

     * [137]7 Qualities of a Winning Data Governance Elevator Speech
       Recorded: Jan 26 2016 61 mins
       Gwen Thomas, Founder, Data Governance Institute and Rob Karel, VP
       Product Strategy, Informatica
       Successful data governance and management programs require ongoing
       goodwill from stakeholders spread across the organization. This
       translates to a lot of communications – formal and informal, long
       and short, planned and unplanned. Wasted time? Hardly! Done right,
       they can result in stakeholders who become vocal advocates for the
       budget, resources, and tools you require to deliver the value they
       need.
       The secret is stitching together your discussions with carefully
       crafted micro-conversations – often called “elevator speeches” –
       that enforce your key messages while intriguing your listeners. A
       winning elevator speech pulls them into your story and prompts them
       to ask for more information. It shows that you understand them, and
       it provides a service, since it may help them connect the dots
       between the message they’ve just heard and similar information
       they’ve heard in colleague introductions, conference room
       presentations, hallway conversations, status reports, and even
       pitches for tools, projects, and executive attention.
       There’s a formula for crafting a winning elevator speech. And it’s
       more than the conventional advice to be short and natural-sounding.
       Learn the 7 qualities of powerful elevator speeches for data
       governance programs, and how to apply them to pitches for support,
       money, attention, participation, and tools.
