   AeroMexico did not allow a well-known Sikh man to board a plane Monday
   because of his beard and turban.

   Actor and designer Waris Ahluwalia, who was on his way to New York
   Fashion Week, shared the following image of with his plane ticket on
   Instagram, with the caption [83]#FearisanOpportunitytoEducate.

   [84]This morning in Mexico City I was told I could not board my
   @aeromexico flight to NYC because of my turban.

   5:58am PST

   A spokesperson from AeroMexico confirmed Ahluwalia was removed from his
   flight.

   "About the situation of passenger Waris Ahluwalia, Aeromexico reports
   that he was asked to submit to screening and inspection before
   boarding, in strict compliance with TSA protocol," the spokesperson
   said in an email to HuffPost. "We have offered the passenger to
   alternatives to reach his destination as soon as possible. We sincerely
   regret any inconvenience caused by this incident."

   Ahluwalia made headlines in 2013 as the first Sikh man in a
   [85]national Gap ad campaign and has had cameo roles in Wes Anderson
   films, among other acting roles. This isn't the first time he's fallen
   victim to racial profiling despite his fame.

   When his Gap ad ran, many of the billboards featuring Ahluwalia were
   vandalized with racist graffiti. The slogan for the campaign was "Make
   Love" but one person wrote "Make Bombs,"[86] referencing misconception
   many have about Sikhs.

   After 9/11, many Sikhs in America have been [89]victims of hate crimes
   and racial profiling due to rising Islamophobia. It has become such an
   overwhelming issue that the [90]FBI is now tracking instances of racial
   bias against Sikh Americans, in addition to Arab and Hindu Americans.

   This article has been updated to include the airline's response.
