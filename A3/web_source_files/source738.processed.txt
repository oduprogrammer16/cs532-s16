[36][Update: Tegra Support] FDG Entertainment's upcoming gritty sniper game
Lonewolf will be landing on Android soon

   Last week FDG Entertainment released their gritty neo-noir sniper game
   called Lone Wolf onto iOS. This game is also slated for release onto
   Android and that is going to be happening in the very near future. This
   isn't your typical sniper game and there will actually be a 17+ rating
   that comes with it. So it won't be for young kids to play.

   Update: February 16th, 12:23pm PST: Just a quick update for those of
   you wanting to play Lonewolf but haven't been able to because you own a
   Tegra-based device, you'll be happy to know that the game has been
   updated and now supports Tegra devices.

   Update: Sunday, February 7th - 3:17 AM, PST: FDG Entertainment just
   informed us that their latest game, Lone Wolf is now available to
   download in the Google Play Store. We have heard great things about
   this game, as it was released first on iOS, not too long. If you are
   interested in checking out this gritty story with excellent art
   direction, the game can be downloaded for free. The game does include
   in-app purchases, but they are minimal. The link to download the game
   can be found at the end of this article.

   Lone Wolf is a dark sniper game that features not only combat in the
   traditional sense, but also in a moral sense as well. This is a
   story-driven sniper game where it isn't just about killing, but dealing
   with the killing and the folks behind the criminal organization known
   as "The Assembly", which you just managed to get into with your first
   kill. You'll be working for The Assembly, being handed various weapons
   that you'll use to carry out the missions they give to you.

   Lone Wolf Features:

   - 5+ Hours Story Mode
   - 30 Missions
   - Hand Drawn Cutscenes
   - More than 20 Weapons
   - Realistic Weapon Sound and Recoil
   - A Dozen Mini-games
   - Several shooting Ranges
   - Trophy Room with more than 40 trophies

   This is a pretty deep game in a multitude of ways, from the story
   itself to the amount of content this game comes with. It won't be a
   game you sit and just blaze through in 30 minutes. If Lone Wolf for
   Android follows the pricing of its iOS brethren, it will be free to
   download with optional IAPs available, which is mainly to get the
   premium version for $1.99.

   You can check out additional screenshots and the game's trailer below.
   We will post an update once Lone Wolf arrives onto Google Play, which
   should be pretty quick.
