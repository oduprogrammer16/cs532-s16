PrEP: Queensland AIDS Council pushes for HIV prevention drug trials expansion
to stop spread by 2020

   By [99]Megan Mackander

   Updated February 13, 2016 15:36:20
   [100]PrEP, short for pre-exposure prophylaxis, is a blue pill being

   The push for the wider availability of the HIV prevention drug PrEP, to
   reach a target of zero new HIV transmissions by 2020, is building
   strength in Queensland.

Key points:

     * PrEP trials approved in NSW, Victoria, as Queensland AIDS Council
       pushes for wider trials
     * Not TGA approved, but accessible via specialists at $140 for
       three-month supply
     * Qld Health Minister 'not ruling out' expanding trials

   [106]A trial of 3,700 people in New South Wales was announced on World
   Aids Day in December, and last week a similar trial of 2,600 people was
   announced in Victoria.

   A smaller trial of 150 men in Queensland began last year, but advocates
   are pushing for that to be expanded.

   The trials make Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) available to men who
   have sex with men, as a means of preventing HIV transmission.

   PrEP — manufactured by Gilead and marketed as Truvada — is not licensed
   in Australia by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and is
   therefore not available at a subsidised price through the
   Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), but many gay men are resorting to
   importing the drug from overseas.

   International clinical trials have proven that when taken once a day,
   PrEP can reduce the risk of infection by up to 90 per cent.

   The Queensland AIDS Council (QuAC) has urged the State Government to
   match or beat PrEP trials of the state's southern neighbours.

   QuAC executive director Michael Scott said while some men were
   importing PrEP, until the numbers accessing PrEP reached a critical
   mass, the benefits of the drug may not be realised.

   "I do not want the situation in 2020 where we knew we had mechanisms to
   prevent HIV transmission in 2016, but did nothing in Queensland because
   it was too hard," he told the ABC.

   "We need widespread access to PrEP now not only to meet 2020 targets,
   but because it is morally and ethically responsible to provide every
   means to reduce HIV transmission to Queenslanders now and in the
   future."

[107]HIV and AIDS: Where are we now?

   [108]Nearly 35 years have passed since the first reports of deaths from
   HIV - so are we any closer to finding a cure?

   Queensland Health Minister Cameron Dick said it was important to
   remember Queensland was the first state to introduce PrEP trials.

   He said he had "not ruled out" expanding the trials, but did not
   provide any solid dates.

   But he said the larger goal was to ensure PrEP was introduced to the
   TGA and therefore available to all gay men.

   "Our Government recognises the valuable role PrEP can play in
   strengthening our chance of further reducing the number of new HIV
   cases we see in Queensland," Mr Dick said

   "But the best way for PrEP to become widely available and accessible to
   those who need it is through its approval by the Therapeutic Goods
   Administration and listing on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme."

   Doctors in Australia can prescribe Truvada "off label" at a cost of
   about $140 for a three-month supply.

   Another option is to purchase a generic version of Truvada from a
   reliable overseas supplier and import it to Australia.

Sexual health control a 'human right'

   Research suggested about 27,150 people in Australia were HIV-positive
   in 2014, with 12 per cent unaware they had positive status.

   In Australia, HIV transmission continues to occur primarily through
   sexual contact between men.
   [109]External Link: PrEP explained

   Mr Scott said PrEP should be viewed as a human right, as much as the
   contraceptive pill is for women.

   "The pill was liberating for women to take control of their sexual
   health and in the same sense this enables many men to take control of
   their sexual health … it's a human right," he said.

   He said while gay men in cities such as Brisbane and Cairns could
   import PrEP through specialist doctors, many men in regional areas were
   missing out.

   Mr Scott said hundreds of men had contacted QuAC about obtaining PrEP
   in just a few months. But at Brisbane's Clinic 30, there are just two
   doctors to meet the growing demand.

   His dream would be for men to be able to obtain prescription and visit
   any chemist across the country for the HIV prevention tool.

   He said similar to the education campaign for the use of condoms in the
   1980s, PrEP would eventually be normalised in gay culture.

   He estimated as many as 3,000 gay men would be interested in accessing
   PrEP, but current pathways to the drug could be difficult and
   expensive.

   "If there are 101 steps to obtaining PrEP, many people could be turned
   off," Mr Scott said.

   "If the process of accessing PrEP is seen as easier, more men would
   take up the offer."
