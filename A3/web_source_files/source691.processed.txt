The 'Saddest Dog In The World' Is Home At Last

Powerful Prank Convinces Woman Not To Put Dog In A Shelter

   [210x.jpg] By [54]Stephen Messenger

   It's difficult to imagine how confusing it must be for the countless
   pets who wind up in animal shelters each year — but this woman got to
   experience that firsthand.

   A [55]powerful new video from French prankster [56]Rémi Gaillard offers
   a stirring glimpse at a world in which people are treated like unwanted
   pets. The prank's unsuspecting target, who's come to drop off a lost
   dog, is clearly unprepared to see what shelter life is like when
   humans' and animals' roles are reversed.

   After seeing humans in kennels, and what happens behind closed doors,
   the woman decides to look elsewhere for help.

   IFRAME: [57]https://www.youtube.com/embed/LotLZaDPbXQ

   Depressing as animal shelters are, it should be noted that the woman in
   this video did the right thing by bringing the lost dog there. Shelters
   are usually equipped to check pets for microchips which would help
   track down their owners.

   In cases where no microchip is found, the [58]American Humane
   Association suggests [59]alternatives to leaving the lost pet at a
   shelter — and for good reason. Every year, millions of dogs and cats
   wind up at such facilities in the U.S., and [60]more than a third of
   them never make it out alive.

   To learn about adopting a pet, or to find out other ways to help,
   [61]visit your local animal shelter.
