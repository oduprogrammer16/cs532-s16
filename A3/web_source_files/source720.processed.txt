Fitch: New Egyptian Bank Rules Could Weaken Asset Quality

   Fitch Ratings-London-20 January 2016: Regulations to boost SME lending,
   issued by the Central Bank of Egypt earlier this month, could weaken
   the quality of loans extended by Egyptian banks in the medium term,
   says Fitch Ratings. Other measures announced by the central bank on 11
   January 2016 are moderately credit positive but are unlikely to
   significantly affect the banks' overall risk profiles.
   The Egyptian government's aim is to increase bank lending to the SME
   sector over four years to end-2020 by EGP200bn, or USD25bn, equivalent
   to 26% of end-3Q15 total banking sector loans. In our view, the drive
   to stimulate the domestic economy is ambitious and could - if
   implemented - force banks to lend to weaker borrowers to fulfil the
   lending quotas.
   It could encourage banks to restructure existing corporate and SME
   loans to meet the quotas, which could lead to understated asset quality
   indicators for the sector. At end-June 2015, non-performing loans
   (NPLs) for the sector represented 7.6% of total loans, which we think
   is reasonable considering the operating environment, but the volume of
   restructured loans not included in NPL figures is significant.
   In addition to the SME stimulus package, the central bank cut large
   exposure limits, but we think this measure will do little to reduce
   high concentration levels in the corporate loan books because, in our
   experience, the large privately owned Egyptian banks rarely utilised
   the maximum available limits. Consumer lending limits were also
   tightened and local-currency limits for investments in single money
   market funds were lowered to 2.5% of deposits from 5%.
   The impact of the SME stimulus package on overall loan quality will
   ultimately be determined by how adequately banks price in the
   incremental risk of lending to smaller, higher-risk customers.
   The central bank set a 5% annual maximum lending rate for SME loans,
   which is well below both the current yield on local treasury bonds
   (around 13% for a five-year bond) and normal commercial lending rates.
   Risk weights on SME portfolios will be reduced, but details have not
   yet been released and any shift away from 0% risk-weighted government
   bonds, which represented over 40% of sector assets at end-September
   2015, will be costly for capital levels.
   We think banks may well seek greater incentives to support the SME
   lending scheme to compensate for low returns, higher capital charges
   and the higher default rates normally associated with SME lending. We
   understand that the central bank is considering introducing credit
   protection guarantees under the scheme but details are not yet public.
   New limits on investments in money market funds should encourage banks
   to prioritise loan growth at the expense of increased investment in
   government debt. In the longer term, this should shift balance-sheet
   structures away from government debt. Loans accounted for a mere 32% of
   total system assets at end-3Q15.
   The strong correlation between sovereign and bank risks effectively
   caps the banks' standalone Viability Ratings (VR) at the level of the
   sovereign rating. A drastic reduction in government debt exposure,
   which we do not expect in the short or medium term, could weaken this
   correlation and lead us to assign VRs above the sovereign rating.
   Private sector banks such as Commercial International Bank (CIB;
   B/Stable/b/AA(egy)/Stable) and Credit Agricole Egypt (CAE;
   NR/NR/NR/AA+(egy)/Stable) are in our view better placed to quickly
   reduce sovereign debt exposure than public-sector banks such as
   National Bank of Egypt (NBE; B/Stable/b/AA(egy)/Stable).
