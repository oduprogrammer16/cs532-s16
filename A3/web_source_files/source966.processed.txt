THE CANDIDATES

   Politics as you’ve never seen them before
   down-arrow
   Films by Christopher Morris for TIMEText by Meghan O’Rourke
   campaign2016final

   Images have always been important in American politics, dating back to
   at least 1860, when Mathew Brady made a daguerreotype of presidential
   candidate Abraham Lincoln, clamping Lincoln’s neck to keep him
   motionless for the long minutes needed to make the exposure. (Brady
   spoke later of how difficult it had been to make Lincoln look
   “natural”; Lincoln, for his part, believed the widely published
   photograph contributed to his victory.) In the last century, our
   understanding of politics was increasingly shaped by such key images,
   whether in magazines or televised debates. FDR’s authority had not a
   little to do with his contrivance never to be photographed in his
   wheelchair, Camelot couldn’t have existed without photographs, and
   Barack Obama’s “Hope” poster was central to his message. Today the sea
   of images is so vast that it’s hard to be grabbed by anything. One
   begins to wonder what Americans might have felt when they saw Lincoln’s
   portrait in Harper’s Bazaar, or Abraham Zapruder’s stills of John F.
   Kennedy’s assassination in LIFE.

   The films make the stale gestures and rhetorical tropes of campaigning
   feel startling, poetic and disturbing.In the films above, we have the
   unusual experience of seeing politics freshly. With their eerie,
   slowed-down time and wealth of visual information, they make the stale
   gestures and rhetorical tropes of campaigning feel startling, poetic,
   disturbing. Shot by Christopher Morris, a TIME photographer who
   developed a distinctive approach to capturing the staged hothouse of
   U.S. politics in his coverage of the George W. Bush White House—heads
   floating in a frame, images of feet, unusual shadows—the films seem to
   expose all that is at once venal and spiritual about American politics,
   precisely by not trying to look natural.

   Here, Morris, assisted by Phantom camera technician Edward Richardson,
   extends that style using the [61]Phantom Miro, a camera never before
   used in political photography, filming at a speed of 720 frames per
   second (it records far more visual information than other cameras).
   Because film typically runs at 24 frames per second, when Morris’
   footage is run back to us at normal speed, it appears spookily slowed
   down, with moving objects and passing surfaces in a kind of suspended
   animation. For a moment, our brains take in more than they normally do.
   This is the way the world must look during a near-death experience,
   Morris has mused. The world we thought to be familiar becomes strange
   and unfamiliar: reminiscent, almost, of a David Lynch film.
   Contributing to this is the sound, which is slowed down to the exact
   same rate as the visuals. The result resembles wind on an alien planet,
   or a preverbal Gregorian chant.

   Athletes in slow motion look graceful—think of the stunningly perfect
   arc of a gymnast’s dismount—but politics under the Phantom’s gaze look,
   well, unnerving. The films reveal a complex interplay of cynical
   political staging and authentic civic hope, where tropes of American
   innocence and political culpability exist side by side. A sandy-haired
   tween boy at a Donald Trump speech bounces slowly up and down in
   excitement; a fresh-faced, auburn-haired girl, ecstatic to see Hillary
   Clinton, bares her white teeth. The candidates, too, seem newly
   exposed: Ted Cruz and Clinton are strangely equalized, their stylized
   gestures, like their ubiquitous finger pointing, appearing aggressive
   and almost violent, and certainly calculated. The camera exposes the
   grammar of physical communication onstage: all the candidates share a
   desire to persuade us, by any means necessary.

   The hopes, expectations and everyday practicalities of politics are
   written on the faces in the crowdsIn a strange way, watching these
   films drives home the import of politics—something that is easy to
   forget amid all the flag waving and the horse-race coverage. Time is
   altered; the camera insists that the eye slow down and really see the
   man selling Trump sweatshirts, or the grizzled middle-aged Cruz
   supporter, unsmiling in the crowd. We take in each person as a member
   of the body politic whose life will be shaped by the election results.
   The hopes, expectations and everyday practicalities of politics are
   written on the faces in the crowds, in the light falling across a barn,
   even in the props and frivolities of the rallies—the buttons, the
   crowd-control fences, the bunting. Here, all becomes newly charged. The
   strangeness jolts us to attention. Funny that it took a camera to make
   us see with our own eyes again.

   since 1990 and is a founding member of the [63]VII photo agency. He is
   the author of My America and his latest book [64]Americans.
