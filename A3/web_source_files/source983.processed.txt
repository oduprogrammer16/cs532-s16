   The [12]Hokies knocked off Clemson 60-57 in the Cassell on Saturday to
   snap a 5 game losing streak, as such, there is GIFTORY.

   Buzz excite.

   [VCT08XS.gif]

   Dunk attempt: successful. (And did he cover some ground through the air
   there.)

   [5GBvqOc.gif]

   That dive by Zach LeDay, which [13]Buzz Williams called the play of the
   game.

   Frank Beamer cameos will never go unnoticed at TKP.

   Celebrations are fun.

   Thanks Joe, appreciate the morning coffee side-dish. Win much, happy we
   are!

   If it ain't orange, it better be maroon...and if it ain't maroon, it
   better be soon!

   time we saw him at a game.

   Hudson had tried the same lane and attempted to dunk it similarly twice
   earlier in the game and was rejected both times. I am not critiquing
   that, just pointing out that he was able to exploit a crease in the
   defense that he saw several times. That dunk was the money shot!
