GUEST POST: How Eating Healthy Fats Will Help You Burn Body Fat

   08/02/2016 by [33]Adam [34]1 Comment

   This is the second of the two-part series written by Emily Benton.
   Today she writes about the importance of consuming the healthier fats
   and the benefits they have on your body. She includes a simple,
   delicious and very healthy recipe at the end of the post to try out!

   In the endeavour to lose weight and eat well, many of us shy away from
   including a lot of fat in our diet. But actually including a variety of
   healthy fats in your lifestyle can lead to an array of benefits and
   actually help you to successfully burn [35]body fat. And what’s more,
   they taste great!

   So, fats aren’t something to be afraid of. Indeed, we know that fat is
   essential for supporting a healthy metabolism. As well as this, they
   also strengthen our immune systems, and play an important role in brain
   function and hormone production. But which fats are the right ones?

   Think nuts, peanut butter, fatty fish such as salmon, cheese and Greek
   yoghurt, to name but a few. Eating all of these foods in moderation, as
   part of a balanced diet, will leave you feeling fuller for longer and
   also enhance your body’s ability to burn fat more effectively.

   Hailed as one of the best sources of healthy fats, is the Avocado.
   Indeed, it’s for this reason that it has received so much attention
   from foodies over the past year or so.

   Most importantly, the mono-unsaturated fats found in avocados are
   burned readily for fuel during exercise, encouraging your body to look
   for energy in fat stores as opposed to carbohydrates. However, these
   delicious fruits do also contain a carbohydrate called ‘mannoheptulose’
   that stilts the release of insulin, which is paramount in the process
   of fat loss.

   One of the easiest and most delicious ways to incorporate avocados into
   your diet, is on toast. Trust me, it’s quick, easy and tastes
   delicious.

   This is also a great recipe if you’ve missed that illusive window of
   opportunity when your avocado is perfectly ripe. They’re easier to
   prepare when they’re a bit softer!

   Avocado on Toast
   Prep time:  2 mins
   Cook time:  2 mins
   Total time:  4 mins

   Ingredients
     * 2 slices of wholemeal or brown bread
     * 1 Avocado
     * A squeeze of lime juice
     * A pinch of chilli flakes
     * Salt and Pepper to taste

   Instructions
    1. Halve the avocado and put the flesh into a bowl and add a generous
       squeeze of lime or lemon juice. This will add a delicious flavour
       to the guacamole and also makes step two much easier!
    2. Using the back of a fork, mash the avocado until somewhat smooth.
       If you prefer more texture to your guacamole then simply go easy on
       the mashing.
    3. Add a pinch of chilli flakes and salt and pepper to taste.
    4. Toast your bread until golden brown and then spread the guacamole
       on top.

   To load your meal with even more healthy fats, why not top with a
   poached egg, slice of smoked salmon or some chia seeds?

   So remember, dietary fats are not something to be afraid of. Expanding
   your knowledge of healthy fats and eating them in moderation will
   actually assist you as well as help you to enjoy your fat loss journey!
