Afternoon summary

     * Nick Boles, the skills minister, has written to ministers setting
       out concessions the government is planning to make on the trade
       union bill because it fears defeat in the Lords, a leaked letter
       has revealed. (See[69] 3.15pm.)

     * Ben Gummer, the health minister, has told MPs that it is “fast
       approaching” the time when the government will impose a new junior
       doctors’ contract. Responding to an urgent question in the Commons,
       he said “we cannot delay this any longer”. He also said latest
       estimates suggest 2,884 operations have been cancelled ahead of a
       24-hour strike by thousands of junior doctors in England on
       Wednesday.

     * Patrick McLoughlin, the transport secretary, has told MPs that
       holding the EU referendum in June would not rule out a decision
       being made on the Heathrow third runway by July. Giving evidence to
       the Commons transport committee, he said the government still hoped
       to decide whether to build a new runway at Heathrow or at Gatwick
       before the summer recess. The EU referendum could lead to some
       delay, he suggested.

   I don’t know yet when the referendum will be; a date has not been set.
   But there will be a period of ‘purdah’ once that referendum is called
   and that may influence our availability to be able to take a decision
   at a specific time.

   If the referendum is June 23, a date that has been talked about, then I
   think we could still be on target to make it before the end of July.

     * MPs from different parties have been making the case for electoral
       reform. [70]At the Make Votes Matter conference the SNP’s Tommy
       Sheppard said:

   We must move on from the 2011 AV referendum which was an
   unenthusiastic, half-baked attempt at change. Real reform of
   Westminster is long-overdue and a fairer voting system – where every
   vote counts – would be a good start to transforming this archaic
   institution.

   In Scotland we already have proportional representation for the
   Scottish Parliament and local elections – it has proven to work well
   and gives voters a stronger say in who represents them. It’s time for a
   fairer voting system to be applied to Westminster elections.

   That’s all from me for today.

   Thanks for the comments.

Cameron's prisons speech - A round-up of reaction

   Here is some reaction to David Cameron’s prisons’ speech.
     * Lord Falconer, the shadow justice secretary, says he is not sure
       how Cameron’s plans will make any difference.

   Labour has long called for governors of successful prisons to be given
   greater autonomy and for prisons to become more rehabilitative so it is
   welcome that the Government is listening and suggesting moving in this
   direction but given their failure to date we await the details.

   It is also important that this takes place alongside a strengthened
   inspection regime, greater accountability and, crucially, measures to
   address the rising violence, self-harm and overcrowding across the
   prison estate.

   The scandalous failure [82]David Cameron condemns is his own. The
   Tories have had five years to improve our prisons and we have heard
   promises of “rehabilitation revolution” many times before. Instead,
   they have cut staff, closed effective jails, decreased transparency and
   presided over a crisis. While Ministers continue to ignore the
   appalling conditions in our prisons and with no additional funding
   provided it is unclear how these announcements will make any real
   difference.

     * The Prison Governors Association says[83] in a statement (pdf)
       governors are not to blame for the problems in prisons.

   The assertion that there is a lack of talented leadership in our
   prisons is untrue. The stripping out of resources, including severe
   staffing reductions, has been the policy of the Government and of the
   senior management within the National Offender Management Service
   (NOMS) for many years now.

   Almost every function within our prisons has been centralised, from
   choosing who provides education and health to who changes the lights.
   The number of staff, including governors, has been drastically reduced
   yet at the same time the prisoner population has increased. This has
   led to an increase in the workloads of all staff, increasing stress
   levels and sickness rates, which has further exacerbated the problem.
   There has also been an increase, beyond acceptable levels, in violence,
   self-harm, self-inflicted deaths and the loss of good order. However,
   these failures cannot be laid at the doorstep of hardworking and
   overstretched staff who are doing their best to maintain an effective
   service.

     * [84]Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal
       Reform, says Cameron needs to tackle the problem of prison
       overcrowding.

   Today brings a welcome speech from the prime minister, which opens up a
   space for radical and rational thinking. The prime minister is right to
   say that we do need prisons, and right to say that we don’t need
   prisons as they are today.

   Prisons are currently violent and overcrowded. As such, they fail
   everyone: victims, the public, staff and prisoners themselves.

   Prison reform, however, is the tip of the iceberg. Improved education
   and increased autonomy for governors will not work if there are people
   crammed into filthy institutions with no staff to open the cell doors.
   We need action now to tackle sentence inflation and the profligate use
   of prison. Then the Prime Minister’s vision can become a reality.

     — Frances Crook (@francescrook) [85]February 8, 2016

     Suicide of a 47 year woman in Low Newton prison, 12th this year &
     third woman. Nothing I heard from [86]@David_Cameron will prevent
     this

     * Anne Longfield, children’s commissioner for England, says she wants
       arrangements for young people held in custody to be improved.

   I am hopeful that the ambition shown by the government in reforming
   adult prisons today will be reflected in its plans for the children’s
   secure estate. Like adults, the rate of reoffending of children in
   custody is appalling with 67% of children reoffending within 12 months
   of release.

   Custody should be far more ambitious for children - promoting
   education, wellbeing and the longer-term development of children, to
   foster desistance from crime. The dramatic reduction in the number of
   children in custody provides a unique opportunity for root and branch
   reform and with this, a chance to further reduce numbers - possibly by
   half - by using more community sentences and technology, wherever they
   can.

     * [87]Kate Paradine, Women in Prison’s chief executive, welcomes
       Cameron’s plan for a review of how pregnant women, and women with
       babies, are treated in prison.

   Whilst we warmly welcome the commitment to enable greater use of
   community sentencing for mothers we urge the government to ensure this
   amounts to an investment in much more than tagging. To truly break the
   cycle, women affected by the criminal justice system need specialist
   support to address common life experiences of domestic violence and
   sexual abuse, substance misuse, poverty, homelessness and difficulties
   with mental health.

   James Treadwell, a senior lecturer in criminology at Birmingham City
   University, has sent out a comment on David Cameron’s prisons speech.
   He says that trying to rehabilitate prisoners in jail is unlikely to
   succeed because it misses the point.

   For 80 per cent of our current prison population, prison is a bad idea.
   They are there not because they are a danger to the public, but because
   they are socially inadequate.

   They are mentally ill, poor, poorly educated, unemployed and lacking in
   even basic life skills. This might sound pejorative, but it’s true, and
   you will not rehabilitate those socially inadequate people in jail. You
   just won’t.

   You won’t change the prospects for their children, you won’t stop their
   offending, you won’t get them jobs, you won’t re-educate or change them
   and you will not increase their pro-social attitudes or victim empathy.

   Treadwell says these offenders should receive punishment in the
   community.

   The Department for Business is not saying much about the Socialist
   Worker scoop. (See [101]3.15pm.) A spokeswoman said:

   We do not comment on leaks. The government is committed to implementing
   the trade union bill and to balancing the right to strike with the
   right of millions of people to go about their daily lives.

Ministers planning concessions over trade union bill because they fear Lords
defeats, leaked letter reveals

   We don’t get the Socialist Worker in the office (although we do get the
   Morning Star - essential reading for anyone following Labour now that
   Jeremy Corbyn is leading the party) but perhaps we should because it
   has a very good story today - the leak of a letter showing that the
   government is planning a series of concessions over the trade union
   bill.

   Here is an extract from [106]the Socialist Worker story.

     The document, dated 26 January 2016, shows that the Tories expect
     the House of Lords to defeat “flagship” parts of the bill. Socialist
     Worker has a letter, marked “Official—sensitive”, from Nick Boles,
     minister of state for skills, to Oliver Letwin and Chris Grayling
     ...

     Boles hopes that “a willingness to give some ground on certain
     aspects of the bill may lead to a less hard line response to the
     bill on other issues”.

     The suggested concessions include:

     * Conceding a review into whether unions should be allowed to conduct
       e-ballots for strikes. This is needed because “the threshold
       provisions (the flagship element of the bill) will be defeated if
       we do not make some move towards accepting the possibility of
       electronic balloting”. Boles made a point of saying there would be
       no date for such a review to report. He cynically said, “I would
       not propose that we should announce the period in which the review
       should report”.

     * Setting up a procedure to consult (underlined in the original) the
       Scottish parliament and Welsh Assembly on the bill. In addition
       Boles suggests the government may have to retreat further in
       Scotland and Wales.

     * Withdrawing the increase in the notice period for industrial action
       from seven days to 14 days.

     * Increasing the time that a ballot is legally valid from four months
       to six months.

     * Deleting the need for a picket supervisor to wear an armband and
       badge.

     The Tories’ disarray should lift everyone as the TUC’s week of
     action against the bill begins on Monday, tomorrow.

   Extract from Nick Boles letter

   Extract from Nick Boles letter Photograph: Extract from Nick Boles
   letter/Socialist Worker

   Here’s a comment from Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, on
   the story.

   The TUC continues to oppose the trade union bill in its entirety.
   However, we are pleased that ministers recognise that large parts of it
   are not fit for purpose.

   This letter exposes the huge legal and constitutional problems the Bill
   will face if it is to come into law in Scotland and Wales. And it
   recognises the independence of the Certification Officer is under
   threat.

   The changes discussed in this correspondence are important. However,
   they do not go far enough. While ministers are right to call for
   check-off arrangements to remain in Scotland and Wales, they are still
   planning on banning public sector employers in England from deducting
   union subs via payroll.

   And holding a review into electronic balloting without an end date is
   simply not good enough. If online balloting is safe and secure enough
   for the Conservatives to select their candidate for London Mayor, there
   can be no excuse for delaying its introduction for union members.

Lunchtime summary

     * David Cameron has said that staff in high-performing prisons could
       receive bonuses under this plans to change the way prisons operate.
       Governors will get much more freedom to determine how jails are
       runs, and performance data will be published, allowing jails to be
       ranked in league tables. Cameron also said he wanted to speed up
       the deportation of foreign offenders and that the police would get
       new powers to require foreign nationals to hand over their
       passports and make them declare nationality in court. And he said
       the government would also work with mobile phone network operators
       to block mobile signals to jails. I will post more from the speech
       when the full text is available.

     * Cameron has defended Downing Street’s decision to suggest that
       leaving the EU could result in the “Jungle” refugee camp at Calais
       relocating to Kent. There were lots of opposition politicians in
       France who wanted to tear up the treaty that means British border
       controls are enforced at Calais, he said. He said Britain should
       not give them the excuse to abandon that treaty.

   There are any number of opposition politicians in France who would love
   to tear up the excellent agreement we have with France to make sure
   that we have our borders on their side of the Channel. I don’t think we
   should give those politicians any excuse to do that.

   My colleague Alan Travis has written a Reality Check on how realistic
   Cameron’s claim is. Here is his article.

   Related: [111]Will there be migrant camps in Kent if Britain leaves the
   EU?

   And here is his conclusion.

   Cameron is scaremongering when he implies Brexit would necessarily lead
   to a mass invasion of asylum seekers from [112]Calais to Kent because
   the current bilateral agreements have nothing to do with the EU.

   There is however a risk that France could end the treaty as a
   “countermeasure” to Britain leaving the EU, but if that occurred it
   would be two years before it took effect.

   It is highly unlikely thatmigrant camps à la the Jungle would be set up
   in the south-east as new asylum seekers in Britain are either dispersed
   to Home Office funded accommodation or held in immigration removal
   centres.

     * The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said leaving the EU would be
       “a huge step into the unknown” , with most of the possible outcomes
       likely to result in lower GDP growth. Even a run of opinion polls
       suggesting that voters may back Brexit in the upcoming referendum
       is likely to cause business uncertainty and prompt companies to
       hold back on investment decisions, said Oxford Economics. As the
       Press Association reports, the warning came in the annual Green
       Budget produced by the Institute for Fiscal Studies in association
       with Oxford Economics (OE), which predicted “significant
       uncertainty” during the two-year negotiation on exit terms which
       would follow a vote to leave. Speaking at the launch of the Green
       Budget in London’s Guildhall, OE’s lead UK economist Andrew Goodwin
       said:

   There are a vast range of possible outcomes, but it is very apparent
   that most of the scenarios in terms of Brexit fall on the downside.
   Most of them involve worse outcomes in terms of GDP growth than the
   baseline forecast. The less migration is restricted and the more the
   government follows a free trade agenda, the less negative those
   outcomes are.

     * [113]The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said that George Osborne
       could be forced to raise taxes or increase his public spending cuts
       if he wants to hit his target of turning Britain’s budget deficit
       into a surplus by the end of the parliament.

     * [114]The Metropolitan police commissioner should apologise for
       leaving two peers to “hang out to dry” over allegations of child
       abuse, the former children’s minister Tim Loughton has said.

     * [115]Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem MP and former Scottish
       secretary, has lost a bid to get his legal costs paid after the
       court challenge against his election failed.

   Q: How concerned are you about deaths in custody. They have gone up
   five-fold in 25 years?

   Cameron says you cannot just put these down to cuts. But the number of
   deaths is appalling. It needs to come down.

   Q: Do you accept that the deal with France over border checks at
   [127]Calais is a bilateral one, and not related to the EU?

   Cameron says it is a bilateral agreement. And it is very good for
   Britain. He is working hard to ensure it stays.

   But there are a lot of opposition politicians in France who would love
   an excuse to tear up that treaty.

   People who want Britain to leave have to start answering questions
   about what it would be like for Britain if we left the EU. They “fear”
   that, he says. But the time will come when they start having to answer
   these questions.

   Q: Do you think all previous governments have been too keen to write
   off prisoners?

   Cameron says people always present prison reform as “soft”. But getting
   prisoners to receive proper education is not soft. And it is not soft
   asking someone in their 20s to admit to the fact that they have a
   reading age of a four-year-old.

   This topic has not been given the political leadership from the top it
   needs.
