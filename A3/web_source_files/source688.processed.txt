   Chris Rock has been one of the funniest men in Hollywood for quite some
   time. He has a solid history as a stand-up comedian, having been on
   Saturday Night Live and In Living Color, but there is a diversity to
   Chris Rock that many fans may not be aware of. Here are some
   unbelievable facts about the 2016 Oscar host.

   1.Moviefone reports that when Chris Rock was in high school, he
   attended schools in white neighborhoods where he would get bullied and
   beat up on a regular basis. As he got older, the situation got worse,
   until his parents pulled him from school. He later went on to get his
   high school diploma through GED and he credits bullying for making him
   who he is today.

     "[Being bullied was] the defining moment of my life... it made me
     who I am."

   2. According to IMDb, Chris Rock has hosted the Academy Awards in the
   past, back in 2005. He was considered an edgy host at that time, but he
   was also a controversial choice because he had told Entertainment
   Weekly the Awards show was nothing more than a fashion show.
