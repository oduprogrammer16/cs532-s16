America’s New Vietnam

   It was half a century ago, but I still remember it vividly. “We have to
   help South Vietnam,” I explained. “It’s a sovereign nation being
   invaded by another nation, North Vietnam.”

   “No, no,” my friend protested. “There’s just one Vietnam, from north to
   south, divided artificially. It’s a civil war. And we have no business
   getting involved. We’re just making things worse for everyone.”

   At the time, I hadn’t heard anyone describe the Vietnam War that way.
   Looking back, I see it as my first lesson in a basic truth of political
   life -- that politics is always a contest between competing narratives.
   Accept a different story and you’re going to see the issue differently,
   which might leave you open to supporting a very different policy. Those
   who control the narrative, that is, are likely to control what’s done,
   which is why governments so regularly muster their resources -- call it
   propaganda or call it something else -- to keep that story in their
   possession.

   Right now, as Americans keep a wary eye on the Islamic State (IS),
   there are only two competing stories out there about the devolving
   situation in the Middle East: think of them as the mission-creep and
   the make-the-desert-glow stories. The Obama administration suggests
   that we have to “defend” America by gradually ratcheting up our
   efforts, from air strikes to advisers to special operations raids
   against the Islamic State. Administration critics, especially the
   Republican candidates for president, urge us to “defend” ourselves by
   bombing IS to smithereens, sending in sizeable contingents of American
   troops, and rapidly upping the military ante. Despite the fact that the
   Obama administration and Congress continue to dance around the word
   “war,” both versions are obviously war stories. There’s no genuine
   peace story in sight.

   To be sure, peace activists have been busy poking holes in the two war
   narratives. It’s not hard. As they point out, U.S. military action
   against IS is obviously self-defeating. It clearly gives the Islamic
   State exactly what it wants. For all its fantasies of an apocalyptic
   final battle with unbelievers, that movement is not in any normal sense
   either planning to attack the United States or capable of doing so. Its
   practical, real-world goal is to win over more Muslims to its side
   everywhere. Few things serve that purpose better than American strikes
   on Muslims in the Middle East.

   If IS launches occasional attacks in Europe and tries to inspire them
   here in the U.S., it’s mainly to provoke retaliation. It wants to be
   Washington’s constant target, which gives it cachet, elevating its
   struggle. Every time we take the bait, we hand the Islamic State
   another victory, helping it grow and launch new “franchises” in other
   predominantly Muslim nations.

   That’s a reasonable analysis, which effectively debunks the
   justifications for more war. It's never enough, however, just to show
   that the prevailing narrative doesn’t fit the facts. If you want to
   change policy, you need a new story, one that fits the facts far better
   because it’s built on a new premise.

   For centuries, scientists found all sorts of flaws in the old notion
   that the sun revolves around the Earth, but it held sway until
   Copernicus came up with a brand-new one. The same holds true in
   politics. What’s needed is not just a negative narrative that says,
   “Here’s why your ideas and actions are wrong,” but a positive one that
   fits the facts better. Because it’s built on a new premise, it can
   point to new ways to act in the world, and so rally an effective
   movement to demand change.

   At their best, peace movements in the past always went beyond critique
   to offer stories that described conflicts in genuinely new ways. At
   present, however, the U.S. peace movement has yet to find the
   alternative narrative it needs to talk about the Islamic State, which
   leaves it little more than a silent shadow on the American political
   scene.

   Vietnam Redux

   That’s not to say that the peace movement is stuck story-less. One
   potentially effective narrative that might bring it back to life is
   sitting in plain view, right there in the peace activists’ most common
   critique of the U.S. war against the Islamic State.

   IS is not making war on the U.S., the critique explains, nor on Europe.
   Its sporadic attacks on those “infidel” lands aim primarily to
   radicalize Muslims living there in hopes of recruiting them. Indeed,
   all IS strategies are geared toward winning Muslims to its side and
   gaining more traction in predominantly Muslim lands. That’s where the
   vast majority of IS-directed or inspired violence happens, all over
   what Muslims call dar al-Islam, “the home of Islam,” from Nigeria to
   Syria to Indonesia.

   The problem for the Islamic State: the vast majority of Muslims are
   just not buying its story. In fact, IS is making enemies as well as
   friends everywhere it goes. In other words, it is involved in a civil
   war within dar al-Islam.

   Every step we take deeper into that civil war is a misstep that only
   makes us more vulnerable. The stronger our stand against the Islamic
   State, the more excuses and incentives we give it to try to attack us,
   and the easier it is for IS to recruit fighters to do the job. The best
   way to protect American lives is to transcend our fears and refuse to
   take sides in someone else’s civil war.

   That’s the positive narrative waiting to be extracted from the peace
   movement’s analysis. One big reason the movement has had such a paltry
   influence in these years: it’s never spelled out this “Muslim civil
   war” narrative explicitly, even though it fits the facts so much better
   than either of the war stories on offer. It radically shifts our
   perception of the situation by denying the basic premise of the
   dominant narrative -- that IS is making war on America so we must make
   war in return. It points to a new policy of disengagement.

   And it’s a simple, powerful story for Americans because it’s so
   familiar. It sends us back half a century and half a world away -- to
   Vietnam. At that time, my friend and (a bit later) I, too, embraced the
   narrative that Vietnam was indeed gripped by a civil war. That
   explanation would play a major role in boosting the success of the
   Sixties peace movement. Within a few years, many millions of Americans,
   citizens and soldiers alike, saw the conflict that way -- and not so
   many years after, all U.S. troops were gone from Vietnam.

   The peace movement's story then was both simple and accurate. No, it
   said, we’re not the good guys protecting one independent nation from
   invasion by another nation. Nor are we fighting an enemy intent on
   doing us harm. Boxing champion Muhammad Ali got it right when he said:
   “I ain’t got no quarrel with the Viet Cong.”

   Intervening in Vietnam’s civil war cost us more than 58,000 American
   lives and did untold damage to the vets who survived, not to speak of
   what it did to millions of Vietnamese. It showed us that, no matter how
   superior our technology, we could not swoop in and win someone else’s
   civil war. Our intervention was bound to do more harm than good.

   Fifty years later, we are repeating the same self-defeating mistake.
   Military action against the Islamic State is leading us into another
   Vietnam-like “quagmire,” this time in Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere across
   the Greater Middle East. Once again, we have enmeshed ourselves in a
   complex civil war abroad with no strategy that can lead to victory. It
   was wrong then. It’s wrong now.

   To put it mildly, the U.S. has a less than stellar track record when it
   comes to intervening in other people’s civil wars. We’ve also
   interfered quite selectively.  In the last two decades, we stayed out
   of brutal conflicts in places like the Congo and Sri Lanka. So a
   decision not to intervene militarily in a foreign civil war should be
   familiar enough to Americans.

   To become neutral is not to condone the grim brutality and reactionary
   values of the Islamic State. It’s hardly likely that
   twenty-first-century peace activists will give the IS anything like the
   sympathy many Vietnam-era protesters offered the insurgents of that
   moment. In this case, becoming neutral merely means suggesting that
   it’s not Washington’s job to fight evil everywhere. Its job is to adopt
   the strategies most likely to keep Americans safe.

   That’s a view most Americans already hold to quite firmly. So the
   “Muslim civil war” story just might get a sympathetic hearing in the
   public arena.

   The Bewildering Maze Of Muslim Civil War

   Of course, the Islamic State is not involved in what we conventionally
   think of as a civil war, in which two sides fight for control of a
   single nation. Even inside Syria, the number of factions involved in
   the struggle, including the oppressive government of Bashar al-Assad
   and rebels of every stripe from al-Qaeda-linked to Saudi-linked to
   U.S.-linked ones, is bewildering. Since IS is fighting for control not
   just of Syria but of all dar al-Islam, many other movements, factions,
   and forces are involved in this Muslim civil war as well.

   Some observers are too quick to simplify it into a battle of
   “traditionalists versus modernizers.” In the U.S. mainstream media that
   usually translates into a desire for us to intervene on behalf of the
   modernizers. Thomas Friedman of the New York Times is probably the
   best-known advocate of this view. Others simplify it into a battle
   between Sunnis and Shi’ites. Since Iran is the leading Shi’ite power,
   those in the media tend to favor the Sunnis.

   All these simple pictures are painted to build support for one side or
   another. The only kind of peace they aim at is one that leaves their
   favored side victorious.

   In fact, no simple dichotomy can capture the tangled maze of struggles
   in dar al-Islam. Sunni traditionalists battle other Sunni
   traditionalists (for example, al-Qaeda vs IS)/  Modernizers join
   traditionalists to fight other traditionalists (for example, Turkey and
   Saudi Arabia in an uneasy alliance to weaken IS). Sunnis and Shi’ites
   become allies too (for example, Kurdish Sunnis and Iraqi Shi’ite
   militias allied against IS). The U.S. supports both Shi’ites (like the
   government of Iraq) and Sunnis (like the oil-rich Gulf States), while
   it resists the growing power of both Shi’ites (like Iran) and Sunnis
   (like IS).

   By emphasizing the true complexity of the Muslim civil war, a peace
   movement narrative can cast that war in a different light. Precisely
   because there are not two clearly demarcated sides, it makes no sense
   to cast one side as the good guys and launch our planes and drones to
   obliterate the bad guys. It’s bound to lead to incoherence and
   disaster, especially in this situation, where the Islamic State,
   however repugnant to most Americans, is arguably no worse than our
   staunch allies, the royal family of Saudi Arabia.

   Given the confusing, some might say chaotic, maze of intra-Muslim
   conflict, it is equally senseless to go on promoting the American
   fantasy of imposing order. (“Without order,” Friedman has written,
   “nothing good can happen.”) Taking this road so far has, since the
   invasion of Iraq in 2003, actually meant unleashing chaos in
   significant parts of the Greater Middle East. There’s no reason to
   think the same road will lead anywhere else in the future.

   Bring the Boys, Girls, and Drones Home

   The Muslim civil war story leads directly to a radical change in
   policy: stop trying to impose a made-in-America order on dar al-Islam.
   Give up the dubious gratification of yet another war against “the
   evildoers.” Instead, offer genuinely humanitarian aid, with no hidden
   political agenda, to the victims of the civil war, especially those
   fleeing a stunning level of violence in Syria that the U.S. has helped
   to sustain. But cease all military action, all economic pressures, and
   all diplomatic maneuvering against any one side in the Muslim civil
   war. Become, as we have in other civil wars, a genuine neutral.

   To call this change of narrative and policy a tall order is an
   understatement. There would be massive forces arrayed against it, given
   the steady stream of verbal assaults the Islamic State levels against
   Washington, which have already inspired one terrible mass killing on
   American soil. We don’t know when, or if, other attacks will succeed in
   the future, whether organized by IS or carried out by “lone wolves”
   energized by that outfit.

   The important thing to keep in mind, however, is that none of this is
   evidence of a war directed against America. It’s mainly tactical
   maneuvering in a Muslim civil war. For the Islamic State, American
   lives and fears are merely pawns in the game. And yet this reality in
   the Middle East runs against something lodged deep in our history. For
   centuries, most Americans have believed that our nation is the center
   of world history, that whatever happens anywhere must somehow be aimed
   directly at us -- and we continue to see ourselves as the star of the
   global show.

   Most Americans have also been conditioned for decades to believe that
   what’s at stake is a life-or-death drama in which some enemy,
   somewhere, is always intent on destroying our nation. IS is at present
   the only candidate in sight for that role and it’s hard to imagine the
   public giving up the firmly entrenched story that it is out to destroy
   us. But half a century ago, it was difficult to imagine that the story
   of Vietnam would be just as radically transformed within a few years.
   So it’s a stretch, but not an inconceivable one, to picture America, a
   few years from now, ringing with cries that echo those of the Vietnam
   era: “U.S. out of dar al-Islam.” “Bring the boys -- and girls and
   bombers and drones -- home.”

   And if anyone says the analogy between Vietnam and the current conflict
   is debatable, that’s just the point. Rather than a rush to yet more
   war, it’s time to have a real national debate on the subject. It’s time
   to give the American people a chance to choose between two
   fundamentally different narratives. The task of the peace movement, now
   as always, is to provide a genuine alternative.
