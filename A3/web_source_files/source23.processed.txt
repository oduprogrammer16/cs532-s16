[79]Vincent Brown Impresses in First Practice Back

   Vincent Brown didn’t deny that it’s been a difficult journey since
   being waived-injured by the Chargers during final roster cuts last
   season.  The wide receiver bounced around from the Oakland Raiders to
   Indianapolis Colts, and had recently been biding his time waiting for
   his next opportunity. When the call came, it was from the team […]

[82]Vincent Brown Returns to the Bolts

     Philip Rivers will have a new wide receiver at his disposal when the

   season, Sunday’s loss would be a strong choice.  Many of the issues

   resulting in a 17-3 loss to the Denver Broncos. Injuries again were at
   the forefront, as four Bolts […]

[91]Arrow Keeps Pointing Up for Jahleel Addae

   Football is a game that rarely sees defensive players on the field for
   100% of the snaps.  With offenses using so many formations and packages
   to dictate personnel, defenses cycle in players to best match up with
   the opposition. Last week against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Pro Bowl
   safety Eric Weddle was one of only two […]
