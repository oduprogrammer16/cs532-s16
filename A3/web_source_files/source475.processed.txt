Job, Career or Vocation?

By Alexa Anghel-Oracle on [18]Dec 07, 2015

   [AAEAAQAAAAAAAASjAAAAJDM4NGNlN2QwLTFlMzMtNDc0YS1iMTI4LThiMTViNGMxYjFjNQ

   Mary works Monday to Friday, eight hours a day in an office. Her main
   motivation is to earn enough money to spend on her after work
   activities. Most of the money goes to her hobby – photography – and to
   other small joys like going out with friends, weekend escapades in the
   mountains and once a year, a vacation outside the country.

   If money wasn’t an issue, she would definitely change her job and would
   try something else. For her, work is a necessity, an 8 hour sacrifice
   in exchange for the after work freedom. Everyday, she patiently waits
   for the 8 hour program to end, Friday is her favorite day and the alarm
   clock every Monday morning is her worst nightmare.

   Alex likes his job, but he doesn’t see himself doing the same thing in
   the future. He dreams of a higher position and a better salary, and to
   achieve this he has a well established plan for his career path.
   Sometimes, he considers his daily tasks to be a waste of time but the
   perspective of a promotion in the future keeps him motivated. To him, a
   promotion is not only the recognition of his value, but also a victory
   in front of his coworkers, with whom he competes.

   To Anne, working is part of life. In fact, if we ask her she will say
   that doing the thing she loves most doesn’t feel like work and that she
   feels lucky to get paid for her passion. There is no border between
   work and free time, they perfectly blend in together in a whole, and
   most of her colleagues are now her best friends. She can’t imagine
   doing anything else and she strongly believes that by doing what you
   love most, you can make the world a better place.

   Who do you feel most like? Mary, Alex or Anne?

   As you’ve probably guessed, the situations stated above describe three
   completely different ways of seeing working: as a job, as a career or
   as a vocation. In an ideal situation, we are all Anne. So what’s
   stopping us? Maybe the often encountered mentality that only few of us
   are lucky to do what we love, while others have to stick to the jobs
   that allow them to pay the bills. Anne isn’t just a lucky case and
   science can prove it. Under the name of “positive psychology”,
   Professor Martin Seligman from the University of Pennsylvania came with
   a very interesting theory on how one can develop and improve potential
   and enjoy a balanced and fulfilled life. We ask ourselves daily what
   makes us happy, and why for some working comes as a joy and not as a
   burden.

   So, if you’re more like Mary or Alex there are 3 lessons you can learn
   to become an Anne.

   1. Instead of always “repairing” your flaws, discover your qualities
   and build on them

   Those who are truly passionate about their jobs are, almost always, the
   ones who are intensively using their best qualities in everyday work.
   We tend to be so caught up in revamping that we forget about what
   actually works, our strengths and how to better perform at our job. Let
   me ask you, when was the last time you were praised for your qualities?
   When was the last time you thought about ways to highlight them? Think
   of your qualities as a treasure hidden buried in your consciousness and
   bring them to light. If you’re a manager, you can apply this analogy to
   your team and stimulate them to use their best qualities.

   2. Look for ways to increase the level of control in your activity

   People who see working as a vocation and not simply as a job, are in
   control of their activities and know very well what’s on their plate.
   One of the biggest reasons for dissatisfaction at the workplace is the
   lack of control and options - when others set for us schedules,
   objectives, dress codes we feel like prisoners for 8 hours and very
   likely become Mary, seeing the job as a burden. Ask your manager to
   involve you in setting the objectives, and ask for tasks that better
   suit your qualities. This way, both parties win, resulting in increased
   motivations and productivity.

   3. Think win-win

   It’s more likely to transform your job into a vocation if you have a
   win-win mindset by actively looking for opportunities to collaborate
   with others. Hyper-competitiveness, permanent struggle with peers, the
   constant pressure to succeed can be a major source of stress and
   dissatisfaction. As people, we are by default social creatures with a
   profound need of networking, and giving and receiving help is among the
   most powerful means to personal fulfillment. When we have few
   opportunities to offer or to receive help, advice, etc. from our
   coworkers and the office mantra is everyone for himself, the level of
   discontent can increase very fast.

   Now, how can you develop a win-win mindset in a culture built around
   win-lose? You can create your own set of levers to help you develop
   professional relationships, by offering some of your experience or, if
   you are a manager, you can create special projects that encourage your
   team to work together but keep in mind to reward them individually.

   Of course, the 3 lessons stated above do not constitute the absolute
   recipe for success, but they give us a good direction for our
   destination in finding meaning and joy in our work. A great job should
   allow you to showcase your best qualities without forcing you to fit in
   default standards. A great job allows you to share knowledge with your
   colleagues and build together on the things you believe in.

   If we try to stick at least to these 3 things, our chances to wake up
   easier on Mondays are greater than ever.
