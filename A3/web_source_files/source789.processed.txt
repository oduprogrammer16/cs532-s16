   It's no surprise ad tech has grown exponentially over the past few
   years. The Exchange Lab, a programmatic marketplace, recently took a
   look at just how far the industry has exceeded expectations over the
   past five years. "It is obvious that ad spend has and will continue to
   grow through digital platforms, and consistently at a rate faster than
   we predict," said Exchange Lab chief strategy officer Tim Webster. "The
   speed of growth in digital marketing naturally brings new challenges,
   such as viewability [issues] and ad blocking. The industry tends to
   thrive off shocking predictions; therefore, marketers should evaluate
   and take considered actions because ad tech continues to show agility
   in addressing these issues, as it has proven so far."
