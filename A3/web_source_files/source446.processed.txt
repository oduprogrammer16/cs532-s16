   Moving across country is a rite of passage (and a test of will) for
   millions of Americans each year.

   But where are they all going?

   Two of America’s leading truck rental companies, Penske and U-Haul,
   recently released separate analyses of where people are moving based on
   their own customer data.

   While their methodology differs, both lists offer unique insights on
   the places where long-distance movers are flocking.

   [39]uhaul

U-Haul’s Top 10 U.S. Growth Cities

   U-Haul determined its list using the net gain of incoming one-way
   rentals versus outgoing rentals for the calendar year 2015. There were
   a total of 1.7 million one-way U-Haul rentals last year.

   The [40]top city on U-Haul’s list? Concord, CA—a city of more than
   122,000 in the San Francisco Bay Area.

   “In conjunction with a great location, Concord remains one of the few
   affordable cities in the Bay Area and is surrounded by cities that
   offer sustained job growth,” said James Bostwick, U-Haul Company of
   East Bay president.

   Coming in second on U-Haul’s list was Roseville-Sacramento, CA ,
   followed by Austin, TX. You can see the [41]rest here.

   U-Haul also analyzed net incoming truck rentals on a state level,
   naming [42]North Carolina the number one growth state.

Penske Truck Rentals Top Moving Destinations

   Penske Truck Rentals considers one-way truck rental totals only for
   their list.

   “Our own data, compiled from do-it-yourself moves across the country,
   mirror the country’s migration and areas of growth,” said Don Mikes,
   Penske’s senior vice president of rental.

   Penske customers made one-way moves to Atlanta more than any other
   city, for the second year in a row. Phoenix came in second on the list,
   followed by Tampa/Sarasota.
