Micca M707z 7-Inch 800×480 High Resolution Digital Phot…

   $59.95

   The Micca M707z displays your treasured photos and memories with
   incredible clarity. With over 3 times the screen detail of standard
   digital photo frames, your photos are shown with remarkable image
   quality, in rich and vibrant colors. See the texture on a leaf,
   individual bricks of a house, or freckles on a face – everything that
   lets your photo tell the story of a captured moment.

   Easy to Use
   The Micca M707z is very easy to use, with no required setup and no
   software to install. Just insert a storage device such as a USB flash
   drive or SD card with photos into the photo frame, turn it on, and the
   slideshow will automatically start. You can even take a SD card from a
   camera and play photos from it directly without any additional
   processing. With a built-in On/Off timer, the M707z can automatically
   turn itself on and off based on a flexible schedule – perfect for the
   office.

   Beautiful and Green
   The sleek and elegant M707z is less than 1″ thick, with a brushed
   aluminum front and curved back, delivering a beautifully modern and
   sophisticated look. It is also very energy efficient, consuming only 7
   watts of power in use, or about 1/2 of an energy-saving CFL light bulb.
   Displaying photos for 10 hours costs less than one cent of electricity.

   Multimedia Experience
   In addition to photos, the M707z also plays videos and music through
   built-in stereo speakers or the headphone jack. A compact IR remote is
   included for convenient access to playback controls.
