Chris Rock has been one of the funniest men in Hollywood for quite some time. He has a solid history as a stand-up comedian, having been on Saturday Night Live and In Living Color, but there is a diversity to Chris Rock that many fans may not be aware of. Here are some unbelievable facts about the 2016 Oscar host.
1.Moviefone reports that when Chris Rock was in high school, he attended schools in white neighborhoods where he would get bullied and beat up on a regular basis. As he got older, the situation got worse, until his parents pulled him from school. He later went on to get his high school diploma through GED and he credits bullying for making him who he is today.
&quot;[Being bullied was] the defining moment of my life... it made me who I am.&quot;
2. According to IMDb, Chris Rock has hosted the Academy Awards in the past, back in 2005. He was considered an edgy host at that time, but he was also a controversial choice because he had told Entertainment Weekly the Awards show was nothing more than a fashion show.
&quot;Come on, it's a fashion show. No one performs; it's not like a music show. What straight black man sits there and watches the Oscars? Show me one.&quot;
