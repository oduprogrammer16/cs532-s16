   Richard Hendron has resigned from UKIP over the candidate [info.png]
   Richard Hendron has resigned from UKIP over the candidate

   A member of UKIP who was hopeful to become a candidate for the party in
   the London Assembly elections has quit.

   Richard Hendron, who had hoped to stand for the party in the South West
   constitutency for the London Assembly elections, quit the party over a
   “vile, nasty, homophobic” candidate.

   Richard Hendron2

   Yesterday PinkNews reported that, following a hustings on Friday, UKIP
   had selected Alan Craig as its candidate for the seat.

   Mr Craig, who was selected at a hustings on Friday evening,
   previously [50]compared gay equality advocates to the invading forces
   of Nazi Germany.

   [51]He was nominated for Stonewall’s ‘Bigot of the Year’ award in 2012.

   His competition, Richard Hendron, has now resigned from the party over
   Mr Craig’s candidacy.

   In a letter addressed to the UKIP party chair, he wrote: “It has become
   clear to me that UKIP is anything but a libertarian party. It is
   a party dominated and controlled by white middle-aged heterosexual men
   who do not believe in libertarian values, equality or valuing
   difference. It’s a party that’s becoming even more small minded, a
   party that goes out of its way to maintain the status quo, a party that
   at best tolerates Gays rather than accepts them, a party that attacks
   difference and undermines equality.”

   Going on, Mr Hendron said he was “lost for words” when he realised UKIP
   had put up Alan Craig against him for the candidacy.

   Noting Mr Craig’s history on LGBT issue, Mr Hendron writes: “There is
   no other way to describe Alan Craig other than a vile, nasty
   homophobic individual who is driven by hatred of the LGBT community. A
   quick Google search shows just how nasty he is.”

   He goes on to say that it is “astounding” that UKIP would put forward
   Mr Craig against a gay man and LGBT activist.

   The letter concludes: “I have tried my hardest to fight for the party
   and LGBT issues but I have been met with a barrage of resistance at all
   levels. UKIP is not really interested in equality, the LGBT group do
   nothing other than tick a box for the party, they do not push for
   change in the party or support LGBT activists who are trying to make a
   change, they even refused my application to join the LGBT group stating
   that being gay and in UKIP does not automatically qualify you for
   membership of LGBT in UKIP.

   “The LGBT group should be lobbying hard for change and stopping the
   likes of Alan Craig becoming a candidate. I have to agree with Tom
   Booker when he resigned as chairman of LGBT in UKIP, saying ‘UKIP is a
   cult that is too willing to entertain bigots’, and that LGBT in UKIP
   is nothing more than public relations stunt to shield the party against
   allegations of homophobia.”

   The Former Christian Peoples Alliance leader, Craig defected to UKIP
   last year and was inserted as a candidate for Brent North over an
   existing local candidate.

   Alan Craig

   However, just days after his selection last April, [52]PinkNews
   revealed that Mr Craig was set to speak at a ‘gay cure’ conference.

   Though conference organisers dropped Mr Craig after
   the PinkNews coverage, UKIP refused to discipline him, claiming that
   “as a party that believes in freedom of speech he has the right to
   speak”.

   It was rumoured that he would stand for UKIP as the mayoral candidate,
   [53]however the party selected  out gay candidate Peter Whittle to run
   instead.

   Mr Hendron, who [54]organised the party’s controversial contingent at
   the Pride in London parade in 2015, [55]confirmed to PinkNews last
   year that he planned to seek the party’s nomination to run for Mayor.

   The barrister and former police officer, stood for
   Parliament in Brentford and Isleworth last May – and is not afraid to
   criticise his own party.

   In 2015, he [56]warned that the party is perceived as “overflowing with
   homophobes, racist and bigots” – adding that Nigel Farage’s remarks
   about HIV during the election were “indefensible” and “did no one any
   favours”.

   The party [57]was later accused of attempting to block Mr Hendron from
   becoming the mayoral candidate because of the comments.
