7 Tips for Working Out in the Winter

   During the cold winter months it is difficult to get up and want to go
   out and exercise. Read below for some tips on how to better your work
   outs during the winter.

   1. Acclimate to the weather. You don’t want to immediately step outside
   and start running. You should warm up inside first. Get your heart
   pumping and your body moving for about 5 to 10 minutes before you go
   outside. This way when you are outside your body is already warm and
   the cold weather wont be so hard on your body.

   2. Dress the part. You might think you need to bundle up to battle the
   cold weather. This is not entirely accurate, you want to wear multiple
   layers that you can take off as your body warms up throughout your work
   out. You want to wear clothes of a dry fit material to shun away
   moisture. Scarves, gloves, and headbands that cover your ears are
   recommended. You don’t want your exercise to end early because your
   ears were cold.

   3. Take Cover. Try to avoid open roads and paths near water. Try tree
   lined trails or City blocks with tall buildings. This will give you
   cover from snow flurries and biting winds.

   4. Start Small. In the winter it is best to cut your workouts in half
   until your body has adapted to the cold temperatures. If you normally
   run 4 miles in the summer, start with 2 miles instead.

   5. Ease Your Airways. Let your airways adapt to the cold air,
   especially if you have asthma or other respiratory problems. It is
   recommended that you wrap a scarf or neck gaiter around your nose and
   mouth to warm up the air before you breathe it in.

   6. Stay Hydrated. In the winter you don’t see how much you are sweating
   like you do in the warmer months. It is easy to not think about staying
   hydrated, even though you can still sweat just as much (especially if
   you are bundled up). Make sure you stay hydrated by bringing a water
   bottle with you.

   7. Be Flexible. You might always work out in the early a.m hours but on
   extremely cold or stormy days it will be best to wait until mid-day
   when temperatures are at their peak and paths are most likely to have
   been plowed.
