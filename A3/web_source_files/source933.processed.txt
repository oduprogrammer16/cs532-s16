   A white [46]Chicago police officer who fatally shot a black 19-year-old
   college student and accidentally killed a neighbor has filed a lawsuit
   against the teenager’s estate, arguing the shooting left him
   traumatized.

   answers: 'When does it end?'

   The unusual lawsuit was filed on Friday amid Chicago city leaders’
   efforts to win back the public’s trust after several cases of alleged
   police misconduct.

   Officer Robert Rialmo’s lawsuit provides the officer’s first public
   account of how he says the shooting happened, on 26 December. It says
   Rialmo opened fire after the 19-year-old, Quintonio LeGrier, swung a
   bat at his head at close range.

   Bettie Jones, 55, was killed accidentally in the incident, which
   occurred at around 4.25am as police responded to a domestic disturbance
   call.

   Police acknowledged in a statement issued at the time that Jones was
   accidentally hit by gunfire. They said LeGrier was “combative” toward
   officers before he was shot.

   LeGrier’s father, Antonio LeGrier, has filed a wrongful death lawsuit,
   saying his son was not a threat to officers. His attorney, Basileios
   Foutris, did not return messages seeking comment on the countersuit.

   The killing by a police officer of another black teen, 17-year-old
   [48]Laquan McDonald in October 2014, which was captured on a video, has
   [49]led to protests in the city and calls for the resignation of the
   Democratic mayor, Rahm Emanuel. Officer Jason van Dyke has pleaded not
   guilty to murdering McDonald.

   One day after LeGrier’s death his mother, Janet Cooksey, said at a
   press conference her son, an honor roll student, did not have a history
   of aggressive behavior.

   “When is the mayor going to help us?” Cooksey said. “The police have
   failed us.”
