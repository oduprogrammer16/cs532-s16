Justin Bieber Got A Record Deal Because He Was 'Beautiful Like A Woman'

   Sunday, February 7, 2016 - 11:45

   In 2016 one of the world's biggest stars [107]Justin Bieber is all
   grown up.

   Instagram
   He may be 21 now, but when he broke onto the music scene in 2009 as a
   16-year-old, his feminine looks and prettiness played in his favour,
   [108]according to LA Reid who was one of he execs that signed up a
   babyfaced Biebs.

   Apparently it was his feminine looks that stood out during their first
   ever meeting, as the shiny-haired teen entered the room.

   In his new book, Sing To Me, Reid recalls the time and notes the impact
   his hair (yes, you read that right) had on him. He said he "could see
   immediately that Justin's hair would be every bit as important as his
   songs, his voice his face, or his presence."

What Do You Mean (Live At The MTV EMA 2015)

   That's a lot of pressure to put on someone's hair, isn't it.

   "This kid was beautiful, like a woman can be beautiful and men rarely
   are," Reid recalls. "He turned it on as soon as he stepped into the
   room."

   "Justin was simply beautiful," he goes on to say. "His superpower was
   his face."

   We're not sure if this is a little weird or whether it's simply a keen
   business decision that's cleary paid off a few years down the line.
   Either way, we're glad his talents were spotted otherwise we wouldn't
   have the endless collection of mega hits such as Baby, What Do You
   Mean?, Sorry and Love Yourself.

   Basically if Justin was an ugly 25-year-old with bad hair, Reid and co.
   might not have seen him as such a marketable figure.

   Thank God for youthful looks and conditioner.
