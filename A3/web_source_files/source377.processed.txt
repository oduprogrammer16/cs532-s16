   by [69]Adam MolinaFebruary 1, 2016

   CES was at the beginning of this past month, so you know there’s some
   cool news to tell. Fitness headphones, turntables, and something called
   a Boomstick are just some of the things we’ll cover in this month’s
   Sound Guys Monthly.

   By the way if your name is Shehan H. and you live in Sri Lanka,
   congratulations you’re the winner of a pair of Master and Dynamic MW60
   headphones. Hope you enjoy them! If you’re not Shehan don’t worry,
   we’re doing another giveaway this month. Keep on reading to find out
   how to enter.

[70]Jaybird announces the new Jaybird X3’s and Jaybird Freedoms

   [71]Jaybird Freedom

   At the beginning of January Jaybird announced not one, but two new
   pairs of fitness headphones. Of course they announced the successors to
   the X2 headphones (aptly named the X3s) but they also announced a
   second pair of wireless buds called the Freedoms. The X3 have a 7 hour
   battery life while the Freedoms have a 4 hour battery. BUT, the
   Freedoms come with a small charging clip that adds another 4 hours of
   juice, totaling at 8 hours. Both have Bluetooth 4.0, are sweatproof,
   and have customizable EQ profiles that save to the hardware of the
   headphones. They’re not out yet but when they become available later
   this year, the X3 will cost $149 and the Freedoms $199.
     __________________________________________________________________


[72]Misfit is trying their hand at audio with their new Specter earbuds

   [73]Misfit Specter

   Misfit took a slightly different approach when it came to these
   headphones as all of the tech that usually goes in the control module
   on the wire connecting the earbuds is found instead inside the clip. Of
   course, you’ll also be able to do fitness things like track your steps,
   distance walked, and calories burned. Misfit claims that the headphones
   have an 8-10 hour battery life and can also be used as a clicker to
   control your presentations, if you really want to be that guy. There’s
   no word on pricing yet but they will be available sometime this Spring.
     __________________________________________________________________


[74]JBL and Under Armour partner for the UA Headphones Wireless and UA
Headphones Wireless Heart Rate

   [75]UA Headphones Wireless[news]

   Everyone is trying to get in on the fitness market, so it’s no surprise
   to see JBL and Under Armour team up for two pretty cool pairs of
   wireless earbuds. The first are the UA Headphones Wireless which come
   in the classic in-ear form with an 8 hour battery life. The second are
   the UA Headphones Wireless Heart Rate which come in a clip-on flavor
   similar to the Powerbeats. These have a 5 hour battery life but can
   also track your heart rate and display the data accordingly in an app.
   Pretty cool stuff if you’re really into fitness. Both are sweatproof
   but not the same price. The UA Headphones Wireless are available now
   for $180 and the Heart Rate headphones are coming this Spring for $250.
     __________________________________________________________________


[76]The Boomstick was announced at CES and could be the solution to bad
headphones

   [77]Boomstick[2]

   Long story short, the Boomstick works similarly to a DAC. Plug it into
   your source device, then plug your headphones to the Boomstick and
   voila! Better audio. However the Boomstick differs from your typical
   DAC in that it doesn’t really convert the electrical signal into
   analog. Instead it uses algorithms to fine tune the signal to get
   maximum clarity based on the headphones that are plugged in. Think of
   it as a way to optimize your headphones rather than optimize the sound.
     __________________________________________________________________


[78]Sony’s announces the new PS-HX500 turntable. Long live the vinyl.

   [79]Sony PS-HX500

   The new turntable is called the PS-HX500 and does more than just play
   your vinyl record, though that is a big part of it. Besides that, the
   turntable will also convert the vinyl into a hi-res audio file that you
   can play back in its full glory when you’re on-the-go, assuming of
   course that you can a device capable of storing and playing those
   files. Sony is quickly building an ecosystem around lossless playback
   and although I personally don’t have one of their hi-res walkmans, this
   turntable make me kind of want one.

[80]Best of January

   [81]Blue Lola[3]

   We were pretty busy this past month but we were still able to check out
   some pretty sick gear. The coolest thing we saw last month had to be
   the Lola headphones by Blue. Though we weren’t quite sure who the Lolas
   were for, that didn’t stop us from enjoying them. The headphones have a
   unique adjustment method and also just look pretty damn awesome. The
   black and white — actually the entire look in general is very Storm
   Trooper-esk and definitely fits the Star Wars vibe that has swept the
   world. They’re comfortable, have a really good sound, and do a great
   job at passively blocking outside noise. They’re not the most portable
   of things, but if you’re looking for a pair of over-ear cans to keep at
   your desk then they more than get the job done.
     __________________________________________________________________


[82]Bang For Your Buck

   [83]Anker Premium[6]

   The Lolas aren’t extremely expensive, but they aren’t cheap. If you
   want something inexpensive but good, check out the Anker Premium, our
   pick for best bang for your buck. It should come as no surprise that
   Anker made yet another good product for not a lot of money. The Premium
   was one of the most asked about speakers we ever got so make sure to
   check out the full review if you want to know all of the gritty
   details. If you’re in a rush heres the cliff notes version: Looks nice,
   strong low end, kinda portable but would probably do better on your
   desk rather than your backpack. Oh and I still hate those damn buttons,
   but that can be overlooked thanks to sound quality.
     __________________________________________________________________


[84]Looking for the Best? Your search stops here.

   [85]jaybird-x2-sg-2

   We’re constantly searching the audio world and making lists of what the
   best products are in a bunch of different category. We figure we can
   help take some of the research off your plate when you want to know
   what some of the best products are in a particular category. This month
   we’re going to recommend one of those list: the [86]Best Bluetooth
   headphones for running.

   We’ve got some picks that you’ve probably heard of before like the
   [87]Jaybird X2‘s, and some that may have slipped under the radar.
   Either way if you’re a runner or looking to get into running, make sure
   to check out this best list.
