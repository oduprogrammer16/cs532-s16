   [68]Jeb Bush recently pointed out that he doesn't need big cowboy boots
   like the sort Marco Rubio wears, because he's already tall enough.

   But it seems he does need a new pair of shoes of some variety, because
   he was photographed wearing one that was taped up at the side.

   An eagle-eyed photographer snapped the scruffy shoe while the former
   Florida governor and Republican candidate attended a campaign town hall
   meeting in Nashua, New Hampshire, on Sunday.

   Prince Charles has famously attended public gatherings wearing

   However, some may argue that when it comes to sporting well-worn
   footwear, Mr Bush is in good company.

   Prince Charles has famously attended public gatherings wearing
   decades-old Lobb shoes, which cost thousands of dollars.

   Last month 6ft 3in Bush ran a Super PAC ad that poked fun at the chunky
   cowboy boots worn by Republican challenger Marco Rubio.

   And when MSNBC Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough told him that some say
   5ft 10in Rubio wears the boots to boost his height, he replied that he
   'doesn't have a height issue'.

   Hopefuls Bush and Chris Christie say Rubio hasn't been tested in a way
   that the governors running for president have, leaving him unqualified
   to be president.

   Bush referred to Rubio as 'a bright, charismatic leader' on MSNBC, but
   described his leadership skills as a 'work in progress.'

   Christie, New Jersey's sitting governor, repeated accusations that
   Rubio recites the same campaign points, calling him a 'talented guy'
   when required to 'deliver a speech, read a teleprompter.'

   Bush also attacked billionaire Donald Trump, with whom he clashed at
   Saturday's GOP debate over the issue of eminent domain, calling him a
   'loser.'

   The debate on Saturday had begun in chaos as several candidates didn't
   come on stage as ABC News moderators David Muir and Martha Raddatz
   called their names.

   Dr. Ben Carson came to the mouth of a backstage hallway at St. Anselm
   College too early, as his name was to be the second called.

   With applause ringing through the hall for Chris Christie, he never
   heard his name.

   Carson stopped just short of entering and was stranded in no-man's land
   and in view of a TV camera trained on the entryway.

   Before he could figure out what to do, Ted Cruz's name was called. And
   then Donald Trump's.

   Trump stopped to stand with Carson, seeming to tell him that he should
   already have been on stage.

   When Marco Rubio's and Jeb Bush's names were announced, the two men
   were still blocking their way. They had to sneak past, with Jeb
   smirking and bumping into Trump on his way out.
