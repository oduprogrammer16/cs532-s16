[19]EMDR: Processing Traumatic Memories

   Picture
   Let's touch on an approach called Eye Movement Desensitization and
   Reprocessing(EMDR). My psychologist used it to help me convert some
   traumatic memories into safe thoughts. For example, during one of my
   psychotic episodes, the voices in my head screamed out vulgar and
   offensive comments while I was in public places. Since one of my
   delusions was that people could listen to my thoughts, I assumed that
   they could also hear the voices. Likewise, I believed that folks
   presumed I was the one using this abhorrent language. This spawned
   intense social anxiety that stayed with me long after I recovered. My
   therapist attacked the situation, using EMDR. Once we completed the
   process, I was able to store the memory in my brain without the
   emotions attached to it. Consequently, being in crowds of people became
   much easier for me.
   EMDR uses an instrument composed of a wide rectangular box with a row
   of lights ranging from one end to the next. Mine also had two small
   pumps that I held in each hand. As I sat in my chair–holding the pumps
   and watching the lights–the lights would blink on and off in sequence
   from left to right in repetition. It was a bit like watching a pendulum
   swing back and forth. Meanwhile, the pumps would pulsate from left to
   right in beat with the lights. As I did this, my therapist asked me to
   visualize a specific memory. Then she posed questions on the feelings
   that particular image evoked, asking how much it disturbed me on a
   scale from one to ten. We repeated the process–with the addition of a
   few added details–until the memory no longer agitated me. In the end, I
   focused on a future, more positive version of the same situation.
   Why does this work? The eye movement affects how the brain processes
   the information. It seems to allow the mind to store unresolved
   thoughts into the file in our brain labeled "worked out."  Once the
   thought is re-categorized, it loses its unfavorable power over us.

       I'm a wife, a mother, a daughter, a sister, a friend, and a
       survivor. I suppose that makes me a lot like you:)
