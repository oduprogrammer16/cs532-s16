   Guess Rudy Giuliani's not a member of the Beyhive.

   The city’s former mayor slammed Beyoncé Monday for her “black power”
   salute during her provocative Super Bowl 50 halftime show with an
   African-American history theme.

   “I think it was outrageous,” Giuliani said on Fox News Monday.

   “The halftime show, I thought, was ridiculous anyway. I don’t know what
   the heck it was. A bunch of people bouncing around and all strange
   things. It was terrible.”

   “This is football, not Hollywood, and I thought it was really
   outrageous that she used it as a platform to attack police officers who
   are the people who protect her and protect us, and keep us alive,”
   Giuliani said.

   “And what we should be doing in the African-American community, and all
   communities, is build up respect for police officers. And focus on the
   fact that when something does go wrong, OK, we’ll work on that. But the
   vast majority of police officers risk their lives to keep us safe,” he
   said.

   Giuliani aside, many fans were impressed by Queen Bey’s performance of
   her new, politically charged single “Formation” — saying she “won” the
   Super Bowl during her guest appearance for headliner Coldplay.

   “I am loving everything about this. Black is the new, old, present AND
   future black,” tweeted Awesomely Luvvie, adding a Black History Month
   hashtag.

   During the halftime show, a bandolier-wrapped Beyoncé raised her fist
   to give the black power symbol in front of a crew of dancers.

   Bey’s dancers were wearing leather and black berets, a symbol of the
   Black Panthers, the militant political movement that was formed 50
   years ago this October.

   The performance riled up the crowd at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara,
   Calif., just 42 miles south of Oakland, where Huey Newton, Bobby Seale
   and others started the Panthers.

   On the football field, Bey and crew spelled out X, a reference to
   Malcolm X.

   In a photo taken backstage after the performance, Beyoncé’s mom, Tina
   Knowles, posed with the dancers — fists raised.

   Another backstage photo shows a dancer holding a sign that reads:
   “Justice 4 Mario Woods,” a reference to a black man who was killed by
   San Francisco police on Dec. 2.

   Beyoncé’s video for “Formation” — which was released on Saturday —
   heightened expectations that she would make a political statement at
   the halftime show.

   The single has been called “a black power anthem for the masses,” and
   the video opens with Bey sitting on top of a police car in New Orleans
   during Hurricane Katrina as the flood waters rise.

   The haunting video for “Formation” ends with Beyoncé going underwater
   as the police car sinks.

   On Friday, her husband, Jay Z, pledged $1.5 million to the Black Lives
   Matter movement.
