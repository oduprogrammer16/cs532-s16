   Imagine that you suddenly started to hear voices, their source is
   unknown, and it is impossible to control them. Most of people are
   likely to be frightened and start to think that they are going crazy.

   It is a common reaction if you do not know the essence of it. And if
   you start to share your impressions with others, there is a good chance
   to get into a madhouse.

   So, your ignorance will bring you sufferings.

DIVINE EARS: WHAT IS THIS? ​

   Everyone can have a similar experience. Every soul (in the human body)
   can have this experience. According to the teachings of Buddhism and
   yoga, a person can develop a set of divine abilities. One of them is
   called Divine Ears.

   At a certain stage of spiritual development of man starts to "hear" the
   information of other worlds (subtle worlds). If you don't develop the
   ability to recollect your past lives, it will be difficult for you to
   understand your current spiritual level. And as a result of ignorance,
   you may commit different unwise things and bring damage to both
   yourself and others.

   In other words, everyone can develop the abilities from the previous
   lives about which ordinary people do not even know. Or people can be in
   a hurry, developing these divine abilities without major phases:
   spiritual growth, soul purification and rising consciousness.

   Some people get into a madhouse because of their ignorance and are
   forced to suffer greatly. Of course, it's a personal karma of each of
   them. And those who read this article have a better karma because now
   they know the information that can lead them to a better destiny,
   happiness in the future, or at least prevent possible sufferings.

WHERE DO MYSTERIOUS VOICES COME FROM?

   Divine Ears are the ability to hear the astral world and the voices of
   its inhabitants. If to consider the world structure according to the
   theory of Buddhism, there are several levels of the astral and causal
   worlds. The Realm of Phenomena has one level and is called Samsara.

   Also, it should be noted that the Realm of Phenomena is connected with
   the lower Astral Realm. The inhabitants of the lower Astral Realm have
   low spiritual development in comparison with the upper Astral entities.
   So, it is logical to assume that they may try to manipulate people for
   their personal benefit.

   What do people from this world can get when they hear the inhabitants
   of the lower Astral Realm? They get fear, false information and
   personal sufferings.
   Understand and identify the authenticity of the information without the
   advice of a knowledgeable person is almost impossible.

   That is why knowledgeable people advise not pay attention to these
   voices (even if they are) until you reach the level of spiritual
   development and clarity of consciousness when you can hear and
   recognize the entities from the upper Astral Realm. These entities can
   be called gods, who typically have a higher consciousness, not looking
   for personal benefits and give the correct information.

   Thus, it is really dangerous to communicate with the astral world
   entities without Guru.So, instead of visiting the madhouses such people
   should find the Master, who preaches the true doctrine.

TRUE DOCTRINE

   This doctrine should contain truthful information about what Divine
   Ears are, how to develop these superpowers, why they are needed, etc.
   Ideally, the true doctrine should be supported by the practical
   experience of practitioners and experience of the Master.

   Even if you found the true doctrine, it is impossible to understand
   many things alone, and you can go a long and dangerous way.
   Therefore, there is a logical need for a True Guru.

A TRUE GURU

   [3]To meet a True Guru, you should have a karmic connection with his
   Great soul. In the ocean of Samsara (or endless series of
   reincarnations), this chance is given very rarely. You are reading this
   article and, thus, have such a karmic connection. So, do not miss this
   chance to meet the Master.

   Some people may feel a desire to learn such information. Others may not
   realize yet that they need it, but feel sufferings like those caused by
   Divine Ears.This article will be useful for these people.
