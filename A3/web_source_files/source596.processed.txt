28 Cars Torched In Weekend Of Leftist Violence In Berlin

   Leftist Violence

An ethnically-diverse Berlin neighbourhood has been rocked by two nights of
rioting by radical left wingers, with a city official calling the attacks
acts of “terrorism”.

   Up to 100 masked leftist political actors set cars alight and threw
   stones in Neukölln, one of Berlin’s most diverse district over the
   course of Friday and Saturday night. Elsewhere in the city some 4,000
   hardened leftists staged a protest against the police and officers are
   now looking into links between the two events, [27]reports Deutsche
   Welle.

   It is thought the attacks, which saw 28 cars burned and police pelted
   with rocks were conceived as revenge for a police operation three
   weekends ago when 500 officers stormed an “anarchist” squat in east
   Berlin, [28]reports Die Welt. The squat had been linked to a number of
   crimes in the area including an officer being jumped and beaten by a
   number of youths.

     — DIE WELT (@welt) [31]February 7, 2016

   When officers stormed the building they found a large number of what
   they deemed potentially dangerous items including a shopping trolley
   full of half-bricks and large quantities of nails. The raid was
   conducted without a warrant and so the officers were denied entry to
   the apartments in the block itself.

   A police spokesman said the cars targeted for burning this weekend were
   high-end models, reinforcing the idea there may have been a political
   motivation behind the attacks. An anonymous on-line group identifying
   itself as the ‘Social Democratic People’s Bicycle Command’ claimed
   responsibility.

   Berlin’s minister for the interior condemned the protest in Neukölln,
   calling the burnings “terrorist acts”. He said that in the wake of
   “leftist anarchists only destruction fellows, they have no respect for
   the property of their fellow citizens”.

   There wasn’t a single arrest made, despite firecrackers, stones, and
   bottles being thrown at officers, five of whom were injured. The
   response to the left-wing violence stands in start contract to the
   police crackdown on the recent PEGIDA march in Cologne, as
   [32]witnessed by Breitbart London, which saw water cannon deployed for
   the use of firecrackers.

   Despite the hands-off policing this weekend, Berlin’s interior minister
   vowed that left wing mobs would not rule the streets.

   Berlin is not the only European city to have seen violence towards
   their police in the more culturally diverse suburbs this weekend.
   Stockholm had a police car burnt with a  thrown fire-bomb on Saturday
   night after officers left is briefly unattended. It was the second to
   be set alight in the area last week.

   The same night in a nearby suburb an ambulance responding to a call had
   its windows smashed. A police spokesman [40]told the FriaTider they
   were fortunate it wasn’t an emergency call-out, and that the patient
   could be transferred safely to hospital in another vehicle. A spokesman
   said had the incident been a medical emergency, the vandalism of the
   ambulance could have been “disastrous”.

   The violence against the forces of law and order has continued beyond
   the weekend. This morning Swedish police were appealing for witnesses
   after an unattended squad in Gothenburg car had its tyres slashed and
   windows smashed. Interior Minister Anders Ygeman said of the incident:
   “It is shocking people don’t show respect”. Expressen [41]reports Mr.
   Ygeman is considering tougher sentencing for those who attack emergency
   vehicles.
