   Chasing Love and Other Ghosts & The Promiscuity Defense

Conversation in a jail cell with God

February 8, 2016

[23]Caleb Pirtle III

   [24]I expected thunder and lightning when I talked to God. I expected
   thunder and lightning when I talked to God.

   Life is Fiction

   HE LOOKED LIKE the one he pretended to be. Then again, he said
   he wasn’t pretending.

   I could tell it when I looked into his eyes.

   He believed.

   No one else did.

   No one else mattered.

   He was dressed in a black suit with white shirt.

   Not even a night in the Fort Worth jail had wrinkled his suit or soiled
   his shirt.

   His black hair was slicked back.

   It had touch of grease.

   It had a touch of gray.

   His shoes were spit shined.

   Someone had removed his black tie.

   He was angry about it.

   He was mad enough to kill.

   Might as well.

   He had killed more than once.

   At least that’s what the police said.

   And he hadn’t denied it.

   The newspaper’s deadline was three hours away when I sat down to talk
   with him.

   I had taken a chance.

   Some prisoners want to talk.

   Most simply sit and stare at the wall.

   Too many questions.

   No answers at all.

   They think I’ll tell the police if they tell me anything.

   I won’t.

   But police may read it in the evening edition.

   I began with the same question I always do.

   “What happened?” I ask.

   He smiled.

   His smile was cold.

   His black eyes were piercing.

   I felt them, and he knew it.

   “When?” he asked.

   “Last night.”

   “What makes you think something happened last night?’ he asked.

   “You’re in a cell now, and you weren’t then,” I said. “Something must
   have happened.”

   He shrugged nonchalantly.

   “I removed a man from this earth,” he said.

   “How?”

   “Does it matter?”

   It didn’t.

   I moved on.

   “Why did you remove him?” I asked.

   “It was his time.”

   Why?

   Always, why?

   “He had sinned,” the prisoner said.

   “Against God?”

   “All sins are against God.”

   “He could have changed his ways.”

   “He had his chances.”

   “Maybe he needed one more.”

   The prisoner grinned.

   “We all have our last one,” he said.

   He shrugged again.

   “He had wasted his last one,” he said.

   The cell was dark.

   It grew darker.

   The cell was cold.

   It grew colder.

   “What did he do?” I asked.

   “He chose the wrong Trinity,” the prisoner said.

   I waited.

   “Wine, women, and the lust for money,” he said.

   “Your woman?”

   The prisoner grinned again.

   He shook his head.

   “Your money?”

   “No.”

   His voice was soft.

   The grin had not faded from his face.

   “The wages of sin are death,” the prisoner said.

   We sat in silence for a moment.

   The silence grew louder.

   I heard my blood running through my veins.

   Maybe it was his blood, his veins.

   “Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord,” he said.

   “Is he the only one you’ve killed?

   “What makes you think he’s the only one?”

   “Did God tell you to kill him?”

   “No.”

   His voice was still soft.

   “He didn’t have to,” he said.

   “Why not?”

   “I am God,” he said.

   I waited for the thunder to roll.

   It didn’t.

   If the lightning flashed, it went somewhere else.

   I didn’t laugh at him.

   The jury did.

   Twenty-five to life, the jury said.

   He didn’t flinch.

   Twenty-five to life, he told me, is nothing but a drop in the bucket
   for God.

       Deluded, yes. Sane enough to stand trial? We don’t execute the
       crazy people, or say we don’t. But we don’t want them running
       around free after they’ve demonstrated (note how that contains
       ‘demon’) that they are making decisions we wouldn’t want made for
       us.
       God does that. But I don’t believe He runs around our earth
       murdering people. He doesn’t have to. He knows when the clock and
       the choices run out.
          + Caleb Pirtle
            And, Alicia, the clock is always ticking. We just don’t have
            to listen to it. If we didn’t executive crazy people, we
            wouldn’t execute anybody at all.

                 You MUST control your spell-checker.
                 Though given big business and government and conspiracy
                 theories, maybe that’s what you intended.
