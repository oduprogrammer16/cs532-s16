gas.

   One icy morning in February 2012, Hillary Clinton's plane touched down
   in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, which was just digging out from a
   fierce blizzard. Wrapped in a thick coat, the secretary of state
   descended the stairs to the snow-covered tarmac, where she and her
   aides piled into a motorcade bound for the presidential palace. That
   afternoon, they huddled with Bulgarian leaders, including Prime
   Minister Boyko Borissov, discussing everything from Syria's bloody
   civil war to their joint search for loose nukes. But the focus of the
   talks was fracking. The previous year, Bulgaria had signed a five-year,
   $68 million deal, granting US oil giant Chevron millions of acres in
   shale gas concessions. Bulgarians were outraged. Shortly before Clinton
   arrived, tens of thousands of protesters poured into the streets
   carrying [36]placards that read "Stop fracking with our water" and
   "Chevron go home." Bulgaria's parliament responded by voting
   overwhelmingly for a fracking moratorium.

   Clinton urged Bulgarian officials to give fracking another chance.
   According to Borissov, she [38]agreed to help fly in the "best
   specialists on these new technologies to present the benefits to the
   Bulgarian people." But resistance only grew. The following month in
   neighboring Romania, thousands of people gathered to protest another
   Chevron fracking project, and Romania's parliament began weighing its
   own shale gas moratorium. Again Clinton intervened, dispatching her
   special envoy for energy in Eurasia, Richard Morningstar, to push back
   against the fracking bans. The State Department's lobbying effort
   culminated in late May 2012, when Morningstar held a series of meetings
   on fracking with top Bulgarian and Romanian officials. He also touted
   the technology in an interview on Bulgarian national radio, saying it
   could lead to a fivefold drop in the price of natural gas. A few weeks
   later, Romania's parliament voted down its proposed fracking ban and
   Bulgaria's eased its moratorium.

   The episode sheds light on a crucial but little-known dimension of
   Clinton's diplomatic legacy. Under her leadership, the State Department
   worked closely with energy companies to spread fracking around the
   globe—part of a broader push to fight climate change, boost global
   energy supply, and undercut the power of adversaries such as Russia
   that use their energy resources as a cudgel. But environmental groups
   fear that exporting fracking, which has been linked to
   [39]drinking-water contamination and [40]earthquakes at home, could
   wreak havoc in countries with scant environmental regulation. And
   according to interviews, diplomatic cables, and other documents
   obtained by Mother Jones, American officials—some with deep ties to
   industry—also helped US firms clinch potentially lucrative shale
   concessions overseas, raising troubling questions about whose interests
   the program actually serves.

   Geologists have long known that there were huge quantities of natural
   gas locked in shale rock. But tapping it wasn't economically viable
   until the late 1990s, when a Texas wildcatter named [42]George Mitchell
   hit on a novel extraction method that involved drilling wells sideways
   from the initial borehole, then blasting them full of water, chemicals,
   and sand to break up the shale—a variation of a technique known as
   hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Besides dislodging a bounty of
   natural gas, Mitchell's breakthrough ignited an energy revolution.
   Between 2006 and 2008, domestic gas reserves jumped [43]35 percent. The
   United States later vaulted past Russia to become the world's largest
   natural gas producer. As a result, prices dropped to record lows, and
   America began to wean itself from coal, along with oil and gas imports,
   which lessened its dependence on the Middle East. The surging global
   gas supply also helped shrink Russia's economic clout: Profits for
   Russia's state-owned gas company, Gazprom, plummeted by more than 60
   percent between 2008 and 2009 alone.

   Clinton, who was sworn in as secretary of state in early 2009, believed
   that shale gas could help rewrite global energy politics. "This is a
   moment of profound change," she later [44]told a crowd at Georgetown
   University. "Countries that used to depend on others for their energy
   are now producers. How will this shape world events? Who will benefit,
   and who will not?…The answers to these questions are being written
   right now, and we intend to play a major role." Clinton tapped a lawyer
   named David Goldwyn as her special envoy for international energy
   affairs; [45]his charge was "to elevate energy diplomacy as a key
   function of US foreign policy."
   "Countries that used to depend on others for their energy are now
   producers," said Clinton. "How will this shape world events? Who will
   benefit?…The answers to these questions are being written right now,
   and we intend to play a major role."

   Goldwyn had a long history of promoting drilling overseas—both as a
   Department of Energy official under Bill Clinton and as a
   representative of the oil industry. From 2005 to 2009 he directed the
   US-Libya Business Association, an organization funded primarily by US
   oil companies—including Chevron, Exxon Mobil, and Marathon—clamoring to
   tap Libya's abundant supply. Goldwyn lobbied Congress for pro-Libyan
   policies and even battled legislation that would have allowed families
   of the Lockerbie bombing victims to sue the Libyan government for its
   alleged role in the attack.

   According to [46]diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks, one of
   Goldwyn's first acts at the State Department was gathering oil and gas
   industry executives "to discuss the potential international impact of
   shale gas." Clinton then sent a cable to US diplomats, asking them to
   collect information on the potential for fracking in their host
   countries. These efforts eventually gave rise to the [47]Global Shale
   Gas Initiative, which aimed to help other nations develop their shale
   potential. Clinton [48]promised it would do so "in a way that is as
   environmentally respectful as possible."

   But environmental groups were barely consulted, while industry played a
   crucial role. When Goldwyn unveiled the initiative in April 2010, it
   was at a meeting of the United States Energy Association, a trade
   organization representing Chevron, Exxon Mobil, and ConocoPhillips, all
   of which were pursuing fracking overseas. Among their top targets was
   Poland, which preliminary studies suggested had abundant shale gas. The
   day after Goldwyn's announcement, the US Embassy in Warsaw helped
   organize a shale gas conference, underwritten by these same companies
   (plus the oil field services company Halliburton) and attended by
   officials from the departments of State and Energy.

   In some cases, Clinton personally promoted shale gas. During a 2010
   gathering of foreign ministers in Washington, DC, she spoke about
   America's plans to help spread fracking abroad. "I know that in some
   places [it] is controversial," [49]she said, "but natural gas is the
   cleanest fossil fuel available for power generation today." She later
   traveled to Poland for a series of meetings with officials, after which
   she announced that the country had joined the Global Shale Gas
   Initiative.
   "We are very firm on this," insists the State Department's Paul Hueper.
   "We do not shill for industry."

   That August, delegates from 17 countries descended on Washington for
   the State Department's first shale gas conference. The media was barred
   from attending, and officials refused to reveal basic information,
   including which countries took part. When Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.)
   inquired about industry involvement, the department would say only that
   there had been "a limited industry presence." (State Department
   officials have since been more forthcoming with Mother Jones: In
   addition to a number of US government agencies, they say attendees
   heard from energy firms, including Devon, Chesapeake, and Halliburton.)

   During the cursory [50]press conference that followed, Goldwyn, a
   short, bespectacled man with a shock of dark hair, argued that other
   nations could avoid the environmental damage sometimes associated with
   fracking by following America's lead and adopting "an umbrella of laws
   and regulations." A reporter suggested that US production had actually
   "outpaced the ability to effectively oversee the safety" and asked how
   we could be sure the same wouldn't happen elsewhere. Goldwyn replied
   that attendees had heard about safety issues from energy companies and
   the Groundwater Protection Council, a nonprofit organization that
   receives [51]industry funding and opposes federal regulation of
   fracking wastewater disposal.

   Goldwyn and the delegates then boarded a bus to Pennsylvania for an
   industry-sponsored luncheon and tour of some shale fields. Paul Hueper,
   director of energy programs at the State Department's Bureau of Energy
   Resources, says the tour was organized independently and that energy
   firms were only invited to the conference itself to share best
   practices. "We are very firm on this," he insisted. "We do not shill
   for industry."

   While the meeting helped stir up interest, it wasn't until 2011 that
   global fracking fever set in for real. That spring, the US Energy
   Information Administration (EIA) released its initial estimate of
   global shale gas, which [52]found that 32 countries had viable shale
   basins and put global recoverable shale gas at 6,600 trillion cubic
   feet—enough to supply the world for more than 50 years at current rates
   of consumption. This was a rich opportunity for big oil and gas
   companies, which had largely missed out on the US fracking boom and
   were under pressure from Wall Street to shore up their dwindling
   reserves. "They're desperate," says Antoine Simon, who coordinates the
   shale gas campaign at Friends of the Earth Europe. "It's the last push
   to continue their fossil fuel development."

   The industry began fighting hard for access to shale fields abroad, and
   promoting gas as the fuel of choice for slashing carbon emissions. In
   Europe, lobbyists circulated a [53]report claiming that the European
   Union could save 900 billion euros if it invested in gas rather than
   renewable energy to meet its 2050 climate targets. This rankled
   environmentalists, [54]who argue fracking may do little to ease global
   warming, given that wells and pipelines [55]leak large quantities of
   methane, a potent greenhouse gas. They also fear it could crowd out
   investment in renewables.

   By early 2011, the State Department was laying plans to launch a new
   bureau to integrate energy into every aspect of foreign policy—an idea
   Goldwyn had long been advocating. In 2005, he and a Chevron executive
   named Jan Kalicki had published a book called [56]Energy and Security:
   Toward a New Foreign Policy Strategy, which argued that energy
   independence was unattainable in the near term and urged Washington to
   shift its focus to energy security—by boosting global fossil fuel
   production and stifling unrest that might upset energy markets. Goldwyn
   and his ideas had played a key role in shaping the bureau, so some
   observers were surprised when he quietly stepped down just before its
   launch.

   When I approached Goldwyn following a recent speaking engagement in
   Washington, DC, to ask about his time at the State Department and why
   he left, he ducked out a side door, and Kalicki blocked the corridor to
   keep me from following. Goldwyn later said via email that he had simply
   chosen "to return to the private sector."

   Around the time of his departure, WikiLeaks released a slew of
   diplomatic cables, including one describing a 2009 meeting during which
   Goldwyn and Canadian officials discussed development of the Alberta oil
   sands—a project benefiting some of the same firms behind the US-Libya
   Business Association. The [57]cable said that Goldwyn had coached his
   Canadian counterparts on improving "oil sands messaging" and helped
   alleviate their concerns about getting oil sands crude to US markets.
   This embarrassed the State Department, which is reviewing the
   controversial Keystone XL pipeline proposal to transport crude oil from
   Canada and is under fire from environmentalists.

   After leaving State, Goldwyn took a job with Sutherland, a law and
   lobbying firm that touts his "deep understanding" of pipeline issues,
   and launched his own company, Goldwyn Global Strategies.

   In late 2011, Clinton finally unveiled the new [58]Bureau of Energy
   Resources, with 63 employees and a multimillion-dollar budget. She also
   [59]promised to instruct US embassies around the globe to step up their
   work on energy issues and "pursue more outreach to private-sector
   energy" firms, some of which had generously supported both her and
   President Barack Obama's political campaigns. (One Chevron executive
   bundled large sums for Clinton's 2008 presidential bid, for example.)
