Taking LSD leads to 'improved psychological wellbeing' - study

Research has found that psychedelic drugs can improve levels of optimism and
openness - while a separate study has found they may help prevent domestic
violence

   LSD can make you more optimistic and more open to experience, according
   to a new study by researchers at Imperial College London.

   The study, [47]The paradoxical psychological effects of lysergic acid
   diethylamide, published this week in the journal [48]Psychological
   Medicine, examined the acute and mid-term psychological effects of the
   psychedelic drug.

   20 volunteers were each given a 75 microgram dose of LSD, introduced
   intravenously, and subjected to a number of tests which were then
   repeated after two weeks. In separate sessions participants were given
   a placebo and undertook the same tests.

   productivity

   Researchers said their findings reinforced the view that psychedelic
   drugs bring on psychosis-like symptoms - yet improve psychological
   wellbeing in the mid to long term.

   Study lead [50]Dr Robert Carhart-Harris noted that the drug produced
   "robust psychological effects, including heightened mood but also high
   scores on the PSI, an index of psychosis-like symptoms."

   "Increased optimism and trait openness were observed two weeks after
   LSD (and not placebo) and there were no changes in delusional
   thinking."

     Imperial College of London research concludes LSD can be "conducive
     to improved psychological wellbeing." [51]https://t.co/wwbT7vBrg9

   Researchers believe that taking LSD brings on an "increased cognitive
   flexibility [that] leaves a residue of ‘loosened cognition’ in the mid
   to long term that is conducive to improved psychological wellbeing."

   This latest research is one of a number of studies that have
   investigated the positive effects LSD can have on mental health.

   • [53]LSD could treat alcoholism because 'trips' make you reassess
   addiction

   In 2012 a study found evidence that the drug could be [54]beneficial
   for alcoholics.

   Looking at evidence from a number of separate trials, researchers found
   that LSD had a positive effect on alcohol misuse, with 59 per cent of
   patients who took the drug having improved at a follow-up assessment,
   compared with 38 per cent who took a placebo.

   A single dose of LSD was founf to produce benefits lasting between six
   and 12 months.

   Another recent study found evidence that psychedelic drugs could help
   [55]reduce domestic violence, as they cause people to behave "more
   peacefully and compassionately".

   Researchers from the University of British Columbia looked at 302 men
   aged 17-40 in the criminal justice system.

   Of the 56% of participants who had used hallucinogenic drugs, only 27%
   were arrested for later intimate partner violence. Among those who
   hadn't taken psychedelics, the level was 42%

   Peter S Hendricks from University of Alabama said: "A body of evidence
   suggests that substances such as psilocybin may have a range of
   clinical indications."

   "Although we are attempting to better understand how or why these
   substances may be beneficial, one explanation is that they can
   transform people's lives by providing profoundly meaningful spiritual
   experiences that highlight what matters most."
