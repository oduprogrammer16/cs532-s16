[20]Top Hillary Clinton Advisers and Fundraisers Lobbied Against Obamacare
and Dodd-Frank

   Hillary Clinton is campaigning as a [24]guardian of President Barack
   Obama‚Äôs progressive policy accomplishments. In recent weeks, she has
   [25]called the Affordable Care Act ‚Äúone of the greatest accomplishments
   of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country,‚Äù and
   [26]promised that she is ‚Äúgoing to defend Dodd-Frank‚Äù and ‚Äúdefend
   President Obama for taking on Wall Street.‚Äù

   Meanwhile, however, Clinton‚Äôs campaign has been relying on a team of
   strategists and fundraisers, many of whom spent much of the last seven
   years as consultants or lobbyists for business interests working to
   obstruct Obama‚Äôs agenda in those two areas.

   Consultants associated with the Dewey Square Group, a lobbying firm
   that has been retained by business interests to defeat a variety of
   progressive reforms, are playing a major role in the Clinton campaign.
   Charles Baker III, the co-founder of Dewey, is a senior strategist and
   the campaign‚Äôs chief administrative officer. Michael Whouley, another
   Dewey co-founder, played an [27]early role in advising Clinton‚Äôs plan
   for the current campaign by convening some of the very first strategy
   sessions. Senior Dewey officials Jill Alper and Minyon Moore are also
   close advisers and [28]fundraisers for Clinton, while at least [29]four
   other Clinton officials have worked at Dewey within the last four
   years. In addition, disclosures show that Clinton‚Äôs Super PACs
   Priorities USA Action and Correct the Record have also [30]paid Dewey
   Square Group for a variety of services in this election.

   Undermining Obamacare reforms

   Dewey, for instance, worked on behalf of the health insurance industry
   during the health reform debate, specifically to block the changes to
   Medicare Advantage that were [31]critical for financing the Affordable
   Care Act. Medicare Advantage, which allows Medicare beneficiaries to
   use plans administered by private insurers, had long served as a cash
   cow for the health insurance industry. By one estimate, insurance
   companies over-billed the government by nearly [32]$70 billion in
   improper payments over just a five year period. Dewey, which had been
   tapped to by health insurers to block cuts from the program starting in
   2007, continued during the Obama era to lobby to protect Medicare
   Advantage, even as such reforms became a major part of how Democrats
   and the Obama administration sought to finance the Affordable Care Act.

   One of the more deceptive components of the Dewey lobbying strategy was
   uncovered when an editor at the Lawrence, Massachusetts,
   Eagle-Tribune [33]realized that the firm had worked quietly to place
   letters to the editor against cuts to Medicare Advantage under the
   names of elderly Massachusetts residents without their knowledge or
   consent.

   Last year, ProPublica‚Äôs Alec MacGillis [34]pressed America‚Äôs Health
   Insurance Plans, a major private health insurance lobby group that had
   retained Dewey, over the controversy. AHIP‚Äôs spokesperson brushed off
   the fake letter incident as the work of an intern and told MacGillis
   that AHIP ended its relationship with Dewey back in 2008, before the
   letters were sent. But tax documents reviewed by The Intercept show
   that a state-level health insurance [35]lobby group called the
   Massachusetts Association of Health Plans, which represents the same
   major health insurance firms as AHIP, [36]continued to pay Dewey
   throughout 2009 to 2012 for ‚Äúgrassroots‚Äù consulting.

   ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any comment for your piece,‚Äù wrote Ginny Terzano, a
   spokesperson for Dewey, in response to an inquiry from The Intercept.

   In 2009, Dewey was also retained by the National Restaurant
   Association, which at the time was lobbying aggressively to block
   health reform rules to require employers to provide health coverage to
   their employees. The National Restaurant Association, derided by labor
   activists as ‚Äúthe other NRA‚Äù for its role in lobbying against efforts
   to raise the minimum wage, paid Dewey [37]$772,110 that year. Charles
   Baker, the Dewey co-founder who now serves as a senior strategist to
   the Clinton campaign, was also [38]registered to influence health
   reform on behalf of the Medicines Company, a drug firm.

   Other lobbyists now closely associated with the Clinton campaign were
   active in the fight against Obama‚Äôs health reforms.

   Heather Podesta is one of the most prolific fundraisers for the Clinton
   campaign, having personally raised at least [39]$348,581, according to
   recently filed disclosures. In 2009 and 2010, Podesta worked as
   lobbyist for the health insurance company Cigna. While working
   for Cigna to [40]influence the health reform bill, Cigna was one of
   several large health insurers to secretly provide over [41]$86
   million in secret payments used to air negative television and radio
   advertisements to defeat the law. Heather Podesta is one of several
   lobbyists now fundraising for the campaign who previously worked for
   insurance interests to influence health reform. Irene Bueno, a
   fundraiser who raised $26,675, [42]lobbied on behalf of CareMore (a
   division of health insurer Anthem) and Blue Shield of California to
   influence health reform as the bill was being debated. Bueno and
   Podesta did not respond to a request for comment.

   Helping big banks undermine financial reform

   On financial reform, Clinton has similarly tied herself to Obama‚Äôs
   legacy. Speaking with MSNBC‚Äôs Rachel Maddow last month, Clinton
   asserted that on Dodd-Frank, Obama‚Äôs financial reform legislation, she
   is one of the ‚Äúmany Democrats‚Äù who are ‚Äúfighting to prevent it from
   being turned back.‚Äù

   Clinton‚Äôs inner circle, however, has lobbied to help obstruct and roll
   back many of Dodd-Frank‚Äôs signature reforms.

   The Benenson Strategy Group, the consulting firm run by Joel Benenson,
   now serving as the Clinton campaign‚Äôs chief pollster and strategist,
   was retained by the Financial Services Forum, a lobbying group for Wall
   Street interests such as Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. Lobbying records
   show the Financial Services Forum has worked over the years to weaken a
   variety of Dodd-Frank reforms. In 2013, the Financial Services Forum
   paid Benenson‚Äôs firm [43]$273,459 while it [44]was lobbying on a number
   of rules that were mandated by Dodd-Frank, including capital
   requirements designed to prevent another financial crisis. Danny
   Franklin, a partner with the Benenson Stategy Group, wrote to The
   Intercept to say the Financial Services Forum is not currently a client
   of his firm, but declined to comment any further.

   Last month, Benenson [45]convened a conference call with reporters to
   ‚Äúderide Bernie Sanders for airing an ad that criticized Wall Street
   firms and the politicians who accept their donations,‚Äù according to a
   report from International Business Times. As IBTimes reported, Benenson
   has also represented JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, among other
   corporate clients.

   Steve Elmendorf, a campaign [46]adviser and fundraiser who has
   collected [47]$30,505 for Clinton, was retained by Goldman Sachs as one
   of the bank‚Äôs ‚Äú[48]primary lobbyists‚Äù working to weaken the Dodd-Frank
   bill. Records [49]show that after the bill was signed into law,
   Elmendorf continued to work on behalf of a number of Wall Street
   clients to ensure the implementation was favorable to financial
   industry interests. Elmendorf was [50]tapped by Citigroup, for example,
   to help the House of Representatives pass the Swap Jurisdiction Clarity
   Act, a bill strongly supported by Republican leadership in Congress to
   allow banks to avoid financial regulations by moving some operations
   overseas ‚Äî a change that [51]experts say could lead to another
   financial meltdown.

   Elmendorf is one of many lobbyists who worked to influence Dodd-Frank
   now helping the Clinton campaign raise cash. Dewey co-founder Charles
   Baker worked on a lobbying team with DLA Piper‚Äôs Matthew Bernstein,
   another major Clinton fundraiser, for Citizen Financial Group to help
   the bank [52]lobby on Dodd-Frank. Disclosures show the efforts included
   work on the Volcker Rule, derivatives regulations, and rules concerning
   overdraft fees, many of the top concerns for the banking industry.
   Arshi Siddiqui, a lobbyist with Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld who is
   currently helping to raise money for the Clinton campaign, worked to
   [53]influence Dodd-Frank implementation on behalf of the Mortgage
   Bankers Association, according to disclosures. Tony Podesta, the
   brother of the Clinton campaign‚Äôs chairman and a [54]fundraiser for the
   campaign, worked for Bank of America to influence Dodd-Frank, according
   to [55]filings.

   Most of the Clinton campaign fundraisers who lobbied on Dodd-Frank did
   not respond to a request for comment. When asked about the work, Tony
   Podesta emailed us to say, ‚ÄúCall B of A.‚Äù An inquiry to Bank of America
   was not returned.

   There are other lobbyists on the Clinton campaign staff. T. LaDavia
   Drane, the Clinton campaign‚Äôs director of African-American outreach,
   [56]previously worked as a lobbyist for a trade group that represents
   Pepsico and Hershey on issues related to obesity and advertising to
   children. Jeff Berman, a senior Clinton campaign official who is
   leading her [57]delegate strategy, previously [58]worked as a lobbyist
   for the private prison firm Geo Group, seeking to influence the federal
   budget, as well as working for TransCanada to help secure approval of
   the controversial Keystone XL pipeline.

   Speaking to The Hill last year, Tony Podesta [59]said that unlike
   President Obama, who instituted a ban on registered lobbyists in his
   administration, K Street will find a more welcome home in a Clinton
   White House.

   ‚ÄúI think Hillary Clinton will be the next nominee and probably be the
   next president, but whomever the next president is will not maintain
   the lobbying ban,‚Äù he predicted. ‚ÄúIt was a good applause line for
   Obama, but it didn‚Äôt seem to make much sense for policy.‚Äù

   Correction: February 9, 2016

   Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this story stated that
   the Financial Services Forum paid Benenson Strategy Group to lobby. The
   firm says it was paid to consult, not lobby.
