Laravel 4 packages showcase #1

   by [22]Creative Punch · December 15, 2013
   [INS: :INS]

   I have a confession to make. I am absolutely in love with Laravel 4,
   but I guess that shouldn’t come as a surprise looking at the fact that
   it is just the most awesome framework there is!

   If you love Laravel as much as I do, there is no doubt you want to take
   it for a spin and realize its full potential once you have the basics
   down.

   One of the beautiful features of Laravel are the easy-to-install,
   easy-to-use Laravel 4 packages that you can include in your Laravel
   project to help you start up your next project as quickly as possible.

   Without further ado, here are some of the packages – in no particular
   order – that I have been using a lot to make coding in Laravel even
   easier and faster than it already is.

Laravel 4 Generators – Jeffrey Way

   Hands down the most useful packages out there to be used in every
   Laravel 4 project.

   It pretty much does what it says on the box. It generates code for you,
   and does this in such a way that it makes CodeIgniter’s 20-minute-blog
   tutorial pale in comparison. 20 minutes? With Laravel 4 generators you
   can do it in about 2 minutes flat!

   It can automagically generate the following with a few simple artisan
   commands:
     * Models
     * Views
     * Controllers
     * Seeds
     * Migrations
     * Forms
     * Tests
     * Resources (this will generate a model, migration and controllers
       for you)
     * Scaffolds (now this will generate pretty much everything to get you
       started prototyping your application at lightning speed)
     * Pivot tables

   In addition to this, there is also a [23]Sublime Text plugin available
   that will give you access to all these generators from within Sublime
   Text.

   Github: [24]https://github.com/JeffreyWay/Laravel-4-Generators

Sentry – Cartalyst

   By default, Laravel 4 comes with a basic User model which includes
   password reminders and other basics. Cartalyst however will offer you a
   full user system with its amazing Sentry package.

   It has the following features:
     * Configurable authentication (can use any type of authentication
       required, such as username or email)
     * Authorization
     * Activation of user (optional)
     * Groups and group permissions
     * “Remember me”
     * User suspension
     * Login throttling (optional)
     * User banning
     * Password resetting
     * User data
     * Interface driven – switch out your own implementations at will

   Not only is it available in Laravel 4, but also in FuelPHP1,
   CodeIgniter 3 and native PHP (through composer). It currently sits at
   version 2.1 and has an alpha of version 3. If you are looking to make a
   website or application that will have to handle multiple users, and
   multiple types of users (Administrator, normal user, premium user, …)
   then Cartalyst Sentry is definitely the way to go!

Laravel-ide-helper – Barryvdh

   If you are beginning to learn Laravel 4, or if you are really attached
   to having autocompletion/intellisense for Laravel 4, then
   laravel-ide-helper is perfect for you. I personally stopped using this
   a while ago but if you don’t want to dive into the Laravel 4
   documentation to look up the naming of every single function you should
   definitely give laravel-ide-helper by barryvdh a try.

   To use this package, you can either grab a pre-generated version and
   drop it in your project, or get the full package and generate your own
   autocompletion file.

   It has automatic phpDoc generation for Laravel Facades, and for Models.

   Github: [27]https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper

Laravel Test Helpers – Jeffrey Way

   Another great package from Laravel demi-god: Jeffrey Way

   This package eases the process of writing tests for a Laravel
   application by offering:
     * A Factory utility (quickly create and populate models)
     * Model test helpers (assertValid, assertBelongsTo, etc.)
     * Controller test helpers (assertSee)
     * Assert and Should PHPUnit wrappers

   Testing in Laravel is very important and should not be overlooked if
   you want your application to be as solid as possible.

   There isn’t much else to be said about this package other than that I
   highly recommend it if you would like to make testing in Laravel just
   that little bit easier than it already is!

Ardent – laravelbook

   Self-validating smart models for Laravel. Validation is something you
   will without doubt use in every single Laravel project. If you have
   ever worked with CakePHP, you know how handy this feature is. You can
   write your model and specify all the validation that needs to be done
   before saving your model to your database. Then when you save the Model
   inside of your Controller, validation will happen automatically instead
   of cluttering your Controllers with a lot of redundant code.

   Using Ardent for Laravel you can specify all the validation, error
   messages, … directly inside your model (valid e-mail, username, …)

   I use this package in almost every project I start up and it cuts down
   my development time by a great amount of time!

   Github: [28]https://github.com/laravelbook/ardent

   I hope this post will help everyone that is looking to speed up their
   development time with some packages that can be used in almost every
   project.

   If you have any suggestions, or packages that you use in a lot of your
   projects over and over again, feel free to leave a commend below and
   I’ll update this post with some information on the package.
   Share the knowledge!
