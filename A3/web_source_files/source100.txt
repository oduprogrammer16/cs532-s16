<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">15/02/2016 – <span style="color: #3366ff;">London, United Kingdom</span> </span>– Media caught lying over Cologne mass rapes</h3>
<p>Apologies for the lack of updates today, but Breitbart London has been busy exposing the lies in the mainstream media about the Cologne mass rapes, sexual assaults and thefts. The Huffington Post, the Metro, Russia Today, and the Independent have all claimed that only three recent migrants to Germany were involved in Cologne. German prosecutor Ulrich Bremer has taken the unprecedented step of coming out and calling theses reports &#8220;total nonsense&#8221; after his words in a German interview were twisted by left-wing outlets in the English-speaking world. <strong><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/02/15/mass-media-migrant-rape-cover-up-huffpo-indy-metro-rt-claim-cologne-sex-abusers-not-refugees-german-prosecutor-total-nonsense/" target="_blank">READ MORE HERE.</a></strong></p>

<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">14/02/2016</span> – <span style="color: #3366ff;">Bavaria, Germany</span> – Interior Minister warns of &#8216;attackers of tomorrow&#8217;</h3>
<p>The Federal Criminal Police Office of Germany (BKA) says about 4,800 unaccompanied child migrants went missing last year, including 431 under the age of 14, with the Bavarian Interior Minister warning they may eventually turn to crime.</p>
<p>Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann <a href="http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article152208833/Bayerns-Innenminister-warnt-vor-Taetern-von-morgen.html">told</a> German newspaper <em>Welt am Sonntag</em>: “If we are not careful and do not rapidly integrate these young people into our society, the new attackers of tomorrow could soon come from the group of young refugees.”</p>

<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">13/02/2016</span> – <span style="color: #3366ff;">Paderborn, Germany</span> – British military families attacked by migrants</h3>
<p>Military police have confirmed that a number of attacks by migrants have been reported by military personnel and their families stationed at Paderborn in Germany, the <em>Express</em> has <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/643541/Migrant-attacks-British-Army-reports-assaults-hoax-calls-Paderborn-base" target="_blank">reported</a>. One woman living at the barracks has told Forces TV: &#8220;If we are going out on a night out we need to plan ahead and not consume as much alcohol.&#8221;</p>

<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">13/02/2016</span> – <span style="color: #3366ff;">Hannover, Germany</span> – Rapist shouted &#8216;Inshallah!&#8217;</h3>
<p>A 25 year old student has been brutally raped and beaten in a dark alley after leaving a nightclub in Hannover. According to the victim, her attacker spoke broken German and repeatedly shouted &#8220;Inshallah&#8221; &#8211; God willing &#8211; as he carried out his attack, oe24 has <a href="http://www.oe24.at/welt/Fluechtling-schrie-bei-Sex-Attacke-So-Allah-will/223772509" target="_blank">reported</a>. A 39 year old Algerian migrant has appeared in court after DNA testing identified him as the rapist.</p>

<p>The German government&#8217;s much-debated Asylum Package II, a raft of measures to give Berlin more control over the migrant crisis may fail to deliver because it has been poorly worded. One of the main measures set out is a temporary halt on the right to family reunion, in which asylum-seeker unaccompanied children can apply to have the German government fly their families over because of the human right to family life.</p>
<p>The enormous number of unaccompanied youths — which includes anyone under age of 18 — has led to an even greater number as relatives to the youths are shipped to Germany, prompting the change to get migrant numbers down for 2016. Yet the fact the majority of unaccompanied minors don&#8217;t register as asylum seekers and instead are given tolerated foreigner status means only 105 minors properly registered in 2015 would actually be affected by the change, <a href="http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article151953105/Kaum-Jugendliche-sind-vom-Asylpaket-II-betroffen.html">reports</a> <em>Die Welt</em>.</p>

<p>Officers at the scene didn&#8217;t prevent the parade from going ahead because although they suspected the satirical float was possibly guilty of acting seditiously, they decided to respect the right of artistic freedom. One of the signs on the tank was a reference to the controversial &#8216;Asylum Package II&#8217;, a new package of government measures designed to give Germany greater control over their borders, but significantly delayed from its planned January implementation date.</p>

<p>German police raided a migrant reception centre this month and catalogued the identities of 46 male migrants who were otherwise off the books, taking fingerprints and data. The information collected will be shared with other European police forces to see if they are wanted for crimes elsewhere.</p>
