3 Needs for the Kings to Address at the Trade Deadline

   Posted By: [54]LiveMatchJimon: February 08, 2016In: [55]Hockey[56]No

   A man should always consider how much he has more than he wants —
   Joseph Addison

   After a one-year hiatus, the Los Angeles Kings are in an ideal position
   with respect to making this year’s playoffs, sitting atop the Pacific
   division with a 31-17-3 (65 points). The San Jose Sharks are seven
   points back, with the surging Anaheim Ducks eight points behind with
   one game in hand.

   And yet, the Kings are no juggernaut, particularly in recent weeks.
   Since January 4th and despite having played eight of thirteen games at
   home, the Kings are just 6-6-1, having scored just 33 goals while
   surrendering 35.

Both the offense and defense have struggled

   Offensively, a number of big guns have gone silent. Tyler Toffoli has
   just one goal and two assists in his past eight games. Center Jeff
   Carter scored one goal in December, two in January and zero so far this
   month. Milan Lucic has lit the lamp just once in 2016, and Marian
   Gaborik remains mired in a season-long slump.

   That’s four top-six forwards misfiring, which a defense-oriented team
   like Los Angeles can overcome as long as the blue line is playing at
   the top of its game. Judging by allowing nearly 2.7 goals per game over
   the past thirteen contests, that’s not been the case.

   Further complicating matters is that pesky $ 71.4 million salary cap,
   in which the Kings are right up against the limit.

The odds of big trade are growing

   deadline

   Following the early January acquisition of Vincent Lecavalier and Luke
   Schenn from the Philadelphia Flyers, it appeared Los Angeles might
   remain on the sidelines at the trade deadline. Although they still may
   stand pat, there is a growing chance general manager Dean Lombardi —
   mindful that his team’s Stanley Cup window is wide open — might push
   the envelope again, just as he did by picking up Jeff Carter at the
   2012 trade deadline and trading for Marian Gaborik two years later.

   Despite the fact that the Kings have no cap flexibility, the trade
   deadline is an ideal time for Lombardi to pick up assets needed for the
   stretch drive and beyond. Only time will tell if he does it again this
   year, but if so, the following are three needs worth addressing.

Deadline need #1: a top-four defenseman

   Los Angeles has a terrific trio of defensemen in Drew Doughty, Jake
   Muzzin and Alec Martinez. Brayden McNabb is an improving stay-at-home
   defenseman with a physical edge, and Luke Schenn and Christian Ehrhoff
   round out a formidable defensive corps.

   With that said, the Kings could use a proven top-four defenseman, which
   would push McNabb to the third pairing. There are few defensemen likely
   to be on the open market more enticing than impending free agent Dustin
   Byfuglien.

     NHL Trade Rumors: Jets' Dustin Byfuglien Reportedly On Kings' Radar
     – https://t.co/tdA1eCmS91 https://t.co/Fub94DR50d

     — Los Angeles Kings (@LAKingsreports) February 5, 2016

   The Kings are reportedly interested in the 6’5″, 260 pound Byfuglien,
   who has been with Atlanta/Winnipeg for 5 1/2 seasons and carries a cap
   hit of $ 5.2 million. The large cap hit and the lack of a first round
   pick in this year’s draft (courtesy of the Andrej Sekera trade with
   Carolina) are obvious impediments to a deal, but that shouldn’t stop
   Lombardi from trying to work his deadline magic.

   Other rumored target: Keith Yandle

Deadline need #2: a top-six forward

   With so many forwards misfiring, it’s only natural that the Kings look
   at what might be available at the trade deadline. Although less likely
   than addressing the defense, there are still offensive possibilities
   worth considering.

   The obstacles on the offensive side of the ice are daunting. Anze
   Kopitar and Tyler Toffoli are untouchable, trading Jeff Carter and/or
   Milan Lucic would be counterproductive, and both Marian Gaborik and
   Dustin Brown carry huge salaries.

   However, there is one young forward who has yet to put it all together
   in parts of three seasons with the Kings who could spark significant
   interest on the open market: Tanner Pearson. Still just 23 years old,
   Pearson has shown promise, such as when he scored five goals and eleven
   assists in a 27-game stretch during November and December. However,
   with just two points in his last fourteen games and given his reduced
   minutes, Lombardi may be willing to roll the dice for a proven
   commodity.

   Jiri Hudler is one of the names that will reportedly be made available
   for trade at the deadline, with Los Angeles having been linked as a
   possible suitor. Able to play both left wing and center, Hudler put up
   31 goals and 76 points just last season and is a former Cup winner with
   the Red Wings. As a bonus, Hudler is strong at puck possession.

   At $ 4 million, the Kings would have to send more than one player the
   other direction or the Flames would need to retain salary to make the
   math work.

   Other rumored targets: P.A. Parenteau, Tyler Bozak

Deadline need #3: futures

   The Kings won’t be sellers at the deadline, but Lombardi may spin a few
   pending free agents for future assets, particularly since the cupboard
   has gotten a little bare in recent seasons.

   Unless re-signed over the next few months, Trevor Lewis will become an
   unrestricted free agent, as will Lucic, Christian Ehrhoff, Luke Schenn,
   Jamie McBain and Jhonas Enroth.

   If Lombardi makes a deal or two to bolster the roster, one or more of
   the above free agents not named Lucic is certain to be involved. Even
   if not, moving Enroth while his value is high could be in the offing,
   especially with Peter Budaj available in Ontario. A number of the
   others could fetch future returns as well.

   So what do you think? Will the Kings make one or more deadline deals,
   or will they stand pat? Leave your thoughts below, or message me
   @McLaughlinWalt.
