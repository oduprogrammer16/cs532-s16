John Kasich Calls Out Conservatives Who Oppose Common Core

   WASHINGTON -- Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) on Sunday criticized
   Republicans who have attacked Common Core education standards and said
   that their opposition has more to do with politics than substance.

   Kasich dismissed criticisms of the standards from those like Louisiana
   Gov. Bobby Jindal (R), who argue that the guidelines will lead the
   federal government to have more control of the education system in the
   United States.

   "The Common Core was written by state education superintendents and
   local principals. In my state of Ohio, we want higher standards for our
   children, and those standards are set and the curriculum is set by
   local school boards," Kasich said on "Fox News Sunday." "Barack Obama
   doesn't set it, the state of Ohio doesn't set it. It is local school
   boards driving better education, higher standards, created by local
   school boards.

   "I've asked the Republican governors who have complained about this to
   tell me where I'm wrong, and guess what, silence."

   So far, 46 states and the District of Columbia [83]have adopted Common
   Core, though three have withdrawn. Common Core attempts to set uniform
   goals and standards for different school systems across the country.
   Critics like Jindal -- who initially backed the standards -- say that
   the federal government has coerced states into adopting the guidelines.

   "What started out as an innovative idea to create a set of base-line
   standards that could be ‘voluntarily’ used by the states has turned
   into a scheme by the federal government to nationalize curriculum,"
   Jindal [84]said in August.

   Speaking in Iowa this weekend, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R)
   said that Common Core had morphed into a "frankenstandard."

   "Folks, what Common Core may have originally been was a
   governor-controlled states initiative to keep the fickle federal
   fingers of fate off of education," [85]Huckabee said. "It has morphed
   into a frankenstandard that nobody, including me, can support."

   Kasich, considered a potential candidate for the GOP presidential
   nomination in 2016, said that he thought opposition to Common Core had
   to be political. In addition to Jindal and Huckabee, Kentucky Sen. Rand
   Paul and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry are among the potential 2016 GOP
   candidates who have criticized Common Core.

   "Part of the problem is today politicians are running to try and to get
   votes ... We run out here trying to solve problems. And we have a
   problem with our education standards and our children's ability to
   compete in the world," Kasich said. "We're not gonna turn this over to
   Washington, or even to Columbus, our state capital. It's local schools
   with local school boards and high standards.

   "I don't know how anybody can disagree with that unless you're running
   for something."
