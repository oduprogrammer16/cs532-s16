Assembly committee advances resolution to give voters a say on North Jersey
casino expansion

   TRENTON — An Assembly committee on Monday approved a resolution that
   would allow voters statewide to decide in November whether to permit
   two new casino licenses to be issued in the northern half of the state.

   The 6-2 vote by the Assembly Judiciary Committee sets up a vote by the
   full Assembly, expected in about three weeks, with the state Senate
   following suit on an identical resolution on March 14, according to
   state Sen. Paul Sarlo, a Wood-Ridge Democrat who is sponsoring the
   Senate bill. If 60 percent of each chamber approves, the referendum
   will go before voters on the Nov. 8 ballot.

   Assemblyman Chris A. Brown, R-Atlantic, raised objections to the
   process. Brown, a member of the committee, said it was premature to
   vote on the resolution until a tax rate for the North Jersey casinos
   was determined so officials could estimate how much tax revenue from
   those facilities would be directed to support redevelopment in Atlantic
   City.

   Both resolutions allow for up to $200 million in new taxes to be
   designated annually to help Atlantic City transition from its heavy
   dependence on casinos. The city’s gambling revenues — $2.6 billion in
   2015 — have declined by about half in the past decade in the face of
   competition from casinos in Pennsylvania and New York.

   “A lot of time carnival barkers promise a lot, but when you come into
   the tent, there’s nothing there,” Brown said, insisting that passage of
   the resolution and the approval by voters of the referendum would “kill
   Atlantic City.”

   But Assemblyman Ralph Caputo, D-Essex, countered, “You’re spinning your
   wheels, Chris.”

   Caputo, the prime sponsor of the bill, said in testimony before the
   committee on Monday that “everyone is panicking” over the economic
   collapse of Atlantic City except Brown — adding that it was worrisome
   that Brown still seeks to maintain the status quo.

   Atlantic City’s casinos pay an effective tax rate of 9.25 percent,
   compared to more than 50 percent paid by casinos in neighboring states.
   Sarlo and Stephen Sweeney, D-Gloucester, the state Senate president,
   have suggested that the

   North Jersey casinos might pay taxes in the 25 to 30 percent range,
   while also saying that the exact amount has not been determined.

   Caputo said after the hour-long committee discussion that he will seek
   to have the tax rate and numerous other details clarified and made
   public ahead of the November referendum.

   Even if voters give the measure the go-ahead, requests for proposals
   from the operators of existing Atlantic City casinos — who under the
   resolution would get first crack at the two North Jersey licenses —
   might not be circulated until mid-2017. So it could be up to five or
   six years before any North Jersey casino tax revenue starts flowing to
   Atlantic City to help fund its redevelopment.

   Jersey City and the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford are
   widely considered to be the most likely sites for the two
   billion-dollar North Jersey casinos. However, the resolution states
   that the new casinos would be built in separate counties at least 72
   miles north of Atlantic City, meaning that any location from New
   Brunswick in Middlesex County on north is a potential candidate.

   A spokesman for Freehold Raceway told the committee that the harness
   track’s owners “would have to think about their continued viability” in
   the face of added competition for gambling dollars from two new
   casinos.
   In written testimony to the committee, Gordon MacInnes, president of
   New Jersey Policy Perspective, a liberal think tank, asked why the
   resolutions were moving forward so quickly.

   “Given New Jersey’s track record with gambling — one of big promises,
   lack of delivery on those promises, and little long-term economic
   benefit — one would think there would be more caution and skepticism
   about expanding casinos to North Jersey,” MacInnes wrote.
