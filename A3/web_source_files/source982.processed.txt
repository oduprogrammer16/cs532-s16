   It's one of the biggest events of the year so it's no wonder
   Hollywood's finest just had to be a part of it.

   On Sunday, celebrities flocked to the Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara
   near San Francisco to take in [72]Super Bowl 50 where the Denver
   Broncos triumphed 24-10 over Cam Newton's Carolina Panthers.

   Peyton Manning, 39, whose dream came true as he won his second Super
   Bowl is almost certain to retire after a career that has seen him named
   MVP five times and regarded as one of the NFL's best quarterbacks
   ever.

   Catherine Zeta-Jones, 46, and Michael Douglas, 71, were the first to
   show up at the game, dressed up in formal smart attire.

   her lips were carefully painted in a mauve hue.

   Douglas looked preppy in a grey sweater over a white shirt and blazer.

   Lady Gaga, who sang the National Anthem, looked radiant in a
   star-patterned dress.

   Later she wore a red suit to belt out the song, which was met by
   applause. The singer was introduced as an Oscar nominee for her work
   with Diane Warren.

   At one point it seemed as if the Poker Face singer shed a little tear
   as she gave the performance her all.

   All morning she had been posting photos to social media about her big
   performance. In one shot, she was seen makeup free with her two dogs in
   a bed.
