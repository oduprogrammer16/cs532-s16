   Football Chairman has become one of the App Store's biggest-selling
   soccer games, with over one million downloads and a rating of 4.5 out
   of 5 from tens of thousands of reviews.

   The concept is simple - build a football club from scratch, starting as
   a tiny non-league team, and see if you can make it through seven
   divisions to the very top. Hire and fire managers, develop your
   stadium, negotiate transfers and contracts... while keeping the fans
   and the bank manager happy. Good luck - you'll need it!

Help/Contact UsIf you've got a query about the game, please have a look at
the FAQs below and see if your question is answered. If not, please click the
mail icon at the bottom to send us a message through our contact form.

Important - phishing scam emails

   If anyone receives a suspicious email claiming to be from Football
   Chairman or Apple and requesting any bank or personal details, they
   should delete it immediately without clicking any of the links or
   attachments.

   This is a common phishing scam email which uses the name of popular
   apps to fool people into entering their bank details.

   At Football Chairman we don't handle any payment transactions
   ourselves. All purchases are dealt with securely by the app stores:
   Apple, Google or Amazon. We never have access to anybody's bank or card
   information, and will never send an email requesting any personal or
   financial details.

Can I load a game from one version of the app into another?

   Yes, you can import saved games from earlier versions of Football
   Chairman into the newer apps - for instance from FC Lite into Football
   Chairman or FC Pro, or from Football Chairman into FC Pro.
    1. From the main summary screen on the first app, click the 'Spanner'
       icon in the top right corner
    2. Enter an email and password and save your game
    3. From the main summary screen of the new app, click the 'Spanner'
       icon in the top right corner
    4. Enter the same email and password as before, then choose 'Load
       Game', and then your should see some 'Import' options further down
       the screen.

   Please note that all imported games will begin at the start of a new
   season, even if your game was saved mid-season. This is so that the new
   game can add any additional data that wasn't included in the earlier
   version.

Can I save the game on one device and then load it to play on a different
device?

   Yes, you can. Saved games are compatible between different devices,
   including from Android to iOS and vice-versa.

My saved games have gone missing!

   If you saved the game on our servers then the saved game(s) will
   definitely still be there - the only reason they wouldn't show is if
   the email or password were spelt incorrectly either when you originally
   typed them or the second time round.

   The most common reason for this happening is when people mis-type their
   original password without realising. If you've tried various
   combinations and still can't find your saved games, fill in our contact
   form and we'll check the database for you.

I can't scroll to the bottom of the screen (iOS users)

   This issue affects a small number of iOS devices - rebooting your
   device and then relaunching the app seems to fix the problem.

I'm having trouble with the in-app purchases (iOS users)

   The first thing to check is whether in-app purchases are actually
   allowed on your device. To do this, go to Settings > General >
   Restrictions.

   If there are no restrictions in place, then rebooting your phone often
   solves the problem. You may also need to sign out and back in to your
   iTunes account.

How do I exit the game? (Android)

   Although the game disables your device's 'back' button, most Android
   devices have a 'Home' button somewhere that allows you to return to
   your main phone screen. Alternatively your device may also have a 'task
   manager' button that enables you to switch between apps.

The game freezes or shows a blank screen when I try to run it

   Close the app down completely and try relaunching it. If that doesn't
   work, try rebooting your device and then relaunching the app. If it
   still doesn't work, try uninstalling the app the download it again from
   the app store. Please note though - uninstalling should always be the
   last resort because you will lose any unsaved game data.
