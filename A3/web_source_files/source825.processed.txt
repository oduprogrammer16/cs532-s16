Middle England must listen to Tommy Robinson

   Posted on [18]July 9, 2013 by [19]The Re-Enlightenment

   Robinson2 Wake up and smell the jihad, kuffar.

   I wrote [20]a post last week called “Time to be honest about the
   English Defence League”, in which I expressed some frank views about
   the EDL and its leader Tommy Robinson, and since then I’ve been
   regretting it. Not because I was too honest but because I wasn’t honest
   enough.

   I’ve spent quite a bit of time thinking about everything more carefully
   and I’ve watched a number of clips of Robinson on YouTube. In short
   I’ve been completely blown away by his bravery, his commitment, his
   intelligence and his integrity. I really think it’s about time everyone
   started taking him seriously for what he is, which is a political
   activist of the highest calibre.

   There are dozens of things on the internet but these are the ones I
   watched. I really hope you commit some of your time to watching them
   (the second one is audio only). If you don’t then I can’t see how you
   can dismiss Robinson so lightly.

   Robinson is completely committed to defeating Islamism. We all know he
   has a dodgy past but that’s nothing unique amongst the general
   population and it’s certainly nothing unique amongst political
   activists. His past doesn’t disqualify him from speaking out against
   Islamism and it doesn’t make his opinions any less valid.

   We forget that [27]taking part in an institutional system of
   rules-based theft is no disqualification to sitting in either of our
   legislative chambers, or that [28]being violent in a Houses of
   Parliament bar (twice) merely makes an elected public official an
   eccentric character, or that [29]committing criminal damage as an
   undergraduate at Oxford University provided you’re wearing a nice suit
   and you’ve had the finest education money can buy, and [30]smoking
   cannabis at Eton College, is no disqualification to becoming prime
   minister of the United Kingdom. Yet criminal convictions are an
   automatic bar to disapproving of ruthless, totalitarian ideologies.

   Robinson’s real crimes are not actual crimes, though. I can’t stand
   class-based victim narratives but even I have to conclude Robinson has
   committed the ultimate crime of being a working class white lad and
   expecting to have an opinion on Islamism, which will be the defining
   issue of the century people reading this blog post will die in. I
   dismissed Robinson because of his background and because of the EDL’s
   image. I should have known better than to be such a snob.

   Do we not believe people can change? We welcome with open arms reformed
   Muslim extremists like the brilliant [31]Maajid Nawaz of the Quilliam
   Foundation precisely because we believe people can change, but we
   refuse to let Robinson escape his past – and Robinson can hardly be
   called a former “extremist” anyway.

   At this point you might expect the self-appointed champion of the
   working classes Owen Jones to chime in with his [32]Chavs: The
   Demonization of the Working Class thesis, but don’t hold your breath.
   That’s because you can’t possibly apply that narrative to a white
   working class lad from Luton who wants to talk about Islamism. Robinson
   has repaid his debts to society and as far as I can see he’s now
   amassing a gigantic credit account.

   In case you’re wondering whether Luton is significant or insignificant,
   it’s significant: it’s where the four 7/7 bombers started their rail
   journey into London. Oh you do remember 7/7, don’t you? I do because I
   got the Tube to work that day. I was sitting at my desk, probably
   surfing the internet or pretending to look busy when I heard a massive
   bang. That bang was the sound of my fellow Londoners being murdered in
   Russell Square.

   ***

   Here’s something you might not know about Robinson: because of the
   numerous death threats against him and his family he was offered a new
   identity and a new location by the state. He refused. If that doesn’t
   represent moral and physical courage of the highest possible order then
   someone can tell me what does. He refuses to leave his home town
   through intimidation.

   The death threats aren’t a figment of his imagination: he has been
   given a number of [33]“Osman warnings”, which are warnings of a death
   threat or high risk of murder that are issued by the police. And a few
   weeks ago [34]six jihadis were sentenced to over 100 years in total for
   plotting to bomb an EDL rally.

   In his videos I’ve seen in Robinson a greater understanding and
   commitment to our fundamental civil liberties than I’ve detected
   amongst 99% of the lawyers I’ve worked with in my career. Robinson is
   warning everyone of the storm that’s already here and yet people refuse
   to listen to him through a combination of snobbery and a fear of being
   associated with this country’s Great Unwashed Underclass.

   Yes, the EDL has an image problem and so does Robinson. So what? Are we
   hoping Islamism will be defeated by a perfectly manicured group of PPE
   students with Double Firsts from Oxford whose highest calling in life
   is to become a faceless Special Advisor in the Ministry of Lies?

   There isn’t a huge field of candidates willing to speak out against the
   backward ideology that is Islamism because the consequences are so
   severe. We’re not just talking about physical danger from Islamists;
   we’re also talking about the perpetual slurs from their apologists and
   also the instinctive assumption from everyone else that anyone who’s
   white (and especially working class) can’t possibly be approaching this
   from anything other than a racist and hateful angle. You really can’t
   be too picky when looking for people to defeat Islamism. You pretty
   much have to take who you get. We’re lucky to have anyone, let alone
   someone as good as Robinson.

   I’m sure there are thugs in the EDL and I know Robinson does too. But I
   have much more confidence in Robinson’s ability and willingness to root
   out his thugs and condemn their actions unequivocally than I do in
   Muslim leaders to do the same with theirs – and with people whose
   appetite and willingness to commit violence far exceeds that of EDL
   supporters.

   One of Robinson’s arguments, which I agree with entirely, is that
   Muslims themselves aren’t doing enough. This is indisputably true.
   Condemnation of violence is more often than not followed by the word
   “but”. It’s always someone else’s fault, always. When Muslims don’t do
   enough or do anything I get very nervous.

   Muslims must do more. They must do a hell of a lot more. We’ve become
   so accustomed to them not doing enough that we seem to have just
   accepted it. A few weeks ago, for example, I was speaking to a female
   Muslim colleague who is very liberal and secular. In fact she’s an
   [35]Ismaili Muslim, a sect that has traditionally been given a very
   rough time from within Islam (precisely because they’re generally
   liberal and secular).

   We were talking about France’s ban on the veil and she told me she was
   “secretly very pleased”.

   Excuse me? Why secretly? Why can’t she say these things openly? She
   makes it ten times harder for us – not to mention her poor Muslim
   sisters who are forced to wear this cloak – to speak out about the veil
   or Islamism when she chooses to remain silent and just greedily enjoy
   the rights that western liberal democracy has given her on a plate.
   Unbelievable.

   Last week [36]a Muslim TV channel was fined £85,000 by the media
   regulator Ofcom for allowing its airwaves to be used by a hate preacher
   to incite the murder of those who insult the Prophet Mohammed. As yet
   there’s no word of criminal charges against the individual preacher.
   Can you imagine the reaction if Robinson were ever to suggest that so
   much as one Muslim should have so much as one of their hairs
   repositioned? Robinson can be forgiven for referring to a “two-tier”
   policing system because he’s absolutely correct. Robinson was warned by
   the police not to retweet death threats against him on the basis it was
   causing distress to people.

   ***

   In one of his videos Robinson said he was hoping Middle England would
   follow. Well I’m a privately educated, second generation immigrant,
   middle class lawyer who lives in a big house with a small mortgage. If
   I’m not Middle England then Anjem Choudary is a moderate. I don’t agree
   with everything Robinson says but his message has got through to me.
   Has it got through to you? If it hasn’t then why? Is it because you
   think Robinson is a racist? On what basis? Is it because you don’t
   trust white working class lads? Or is it because you simply haven’t
   bothered listening to a word he’s been saying because you’ve already
   been told a hundred times how terrible he is? It’s time to think for
   yourself for a change.

   People need to grow up and they need to listen to Robinson. Just watch
   some of those links. Robinson is living with death threats. The least
   you can do is watch a few YouTube clips in safety.

   To many people Robinson is evil personified whereas the likes of Anjem
   Choudary have almost become harmless pantomime villains (boo, hiss,
   he’s behind you, etc). People are more scared of Robinson and the EDL
   than they are of Choudary and Islamism. This is absurd. One of these
   men is committed to non-violence and preserving our fundamental civil
   liberties and the other is committed to toppling democracy and
   replacing it with Sharia. Go figure.

   If you still feel uncomfortable supporting the EDL or Tommy Robinson
   then how about at least resisting the impulse to dismiss them as
   far-right racist thugs? At least just stay silent. Don’t add to
   Robinson’s problems because he has enough already. I’m just an
   anonymous keyboard warrior sitting behind an old, shitty laptop which
   has a power problem but at least I’m doing something. What are you
   doing? Are you making things better, are you leaving them the same or
   are you making things even worse by demonizing Robinson for no real
   reason other than because everyone around you is doing the same?

   It’s so easy to be a snob. I know because I am one. The EDL are in the
   main a bunch of white working class lads who like football. It’s
   perfectly fair to say grammar and spelling are not their strong suits.
   These are crimes of the century, obviously, and yet another reason why
   they’re not allowed a view on Islamism.

   ***

   As a secularist I’m not particularly wild on the EDL’s occasional
   references to Christianity, or the Christian imagery, but then again
   I’m not particularly bothered about it either. I have no reason to
   believe they want to replace one form of violent theocracy with
   another. They basically just want Islamism to be defeated, the law to
   be applied equally to everyone, and our civil liberties and way of life
   to be preserved, and those are all fine objectives that any secularist
   should be able to embrace.

   I don’t expect the EDL to get too excited about issues like bishops in
   the House of Lords because that’s not why the EDL exists. If I want the
   latest on that debate I can check out the websites of the [37]National
   Secular Society or the Christian think tank [38]Ekklesia. And although
   I want Christianity to lose its power and privileges I don’t want that
   to happen violently or through fear, and I certainly don’t want our
   state religion to be replaced with one that’s a thousand times as
   hideous.

   Robinson might not always emphasise the distinction between Islam and
   Islamism but that’s not particularly important.  The case against
   Islamism doesn’t succeed or fail if you don’t use those terms correctly
   each and every time.

   In fact the distinction between Islam and Islamism is becoming
   increasingly meaningless anyway (and for an excellent discussion of the
   “blurry line between Islam and Islamism” see Rod Liddle in The
   Spectator [39]here). In practice it’s almost impossible to pinpoint
   where Islam ends and Islamism begins. The crucial point is that people
   have rights but ideologies don’t. Ideologies aren’t capable of having
   rights.

   ***

   The scale of the task Robinson has taken on was well demonstrated in
   the BBC3 link above. It was basically a drowning Robinson versus a
   whole TV studio audience and panel. He kept asking people why they were
   calling him a racist and a bigot and no-one could provide a convincing
   answer. He explained that he and his family had received numerous death
   threats, to which the former Apprentice contestant Saira Khan replied,
   “well stop being a racist and a bigot then!” Cue delirious laughter and
   applause from smug metropolitan wankers who probably think Freedom is a
   brand of sanitary towels or the latest boy band.

   The reaction to Khan’s response is deeply troubling on a number of
   levels. Firstly, no-one could explain to Robinson why he was a racist
   or a bigot in the first place; they just assumed he was. Secondly,
   since when has being a racist or a bigot justified a death sentence in
   the United Kingdom anyway, morally or legally? And thirdly, notice the
   not-so-subtle shift of culpability from perpetrator to victim here.
   This, ladies and gentleman, is Sharia and Islamism in one easy
   nutshell. Don’t want death threats? Well don’t criticise Islam then.
   Don’t want to get raped? Well cover up then. Don’t want to be executed
   for apostasy? Well don’t leave Islam then.

   It’s simple really. As long as you do absolutely everything Islam
   demands and you never criticise it then you’ll be…well you won’t be
   safe but you will buy yourself some time while Islamists concentrate on
   more troublesome opponents. If you’re lucky you might just buy yourself
   enough time for a nice little life. As for your kids, who knows. Who
   cares. That’s their problem. Robinson readily admits he’s terrified
   about what Islamism has in store for his children. Aren’t you?

   The second link above is a radio clash between Robinson and the
   [40]renowned apologist for Islamism, Respect Party MP George Galloway.
   Galloway persisted in asking Robinson why he has used different names.
   It’s because of death threats. Is that a good enough reason for you,
   George?

   Robinson explained how he had once gone to a Respect Party meeting with
   a female companion only to discover there was gender segregation, but
   Galloway wasn’t too concerned about that. Instead he picked up Robinson
   on his use of the word “bird” to describe a female. Yes, this is George
   Galloway, apologist for Islamism, an ideology that barely gives women
   animal rights let alone human ones, and who has [41]some pretty sketchy
   views on rape to boot, in his new role as Fearless Conqueror of
   Misogyny.

   Galloway was also interested in how Robinson had become leader of the
   EDL (which is a non-membership organisation) and he questioned
   Robinson’s commitment to democracy on the basis there wasn’t an
   election to appoint him. So in order to speak out against Islamism, an
   ideology which is rotten to its very core and which is fundamentally
   anti-democratic, you apparently now need to win an election.

   ***

   Just as the Middle East has demonstrated [42]it might finally be
   separating Islam and power (and check out [43]this heart-warming link
   featuring a 12-year old Egyptian kid), here we are embracing Islamism
   in the United Kingdom. We’re self-censoring out of “respect”. And we’re
   selling out brave individuals like Robinson on a truly epic scale. This
   is shameful.

   What have we become? I’ll tell you. We’ve become consumers who have
   been binge-eating freedom to the point where we’ve become sick. We’ve
   forgotten that our freedoms are valuable. We’ve forgotten that they’ve
   been incredibly difficult to obtain and that the currency for obtaining
   them was unquantifiable amounts of human blood and guts. We haven’t got
   a clue how difficult it is to get freedoms back once they’re gone. And
   along comes a working class white lad from Luton who isn’t prepared to
   let these freedoms die quietly and who understands the importance of
   freedom of speech, the right to protest and freedom of association.
   Someone for whom these freedoms are not obscure academic concepts but
   real, valuable things. Someone who is willing to take a stand against
   religious brutality whatever the cost to him may be. And yet somehow
   hardly anyone is willing to accept that defending and exercising those
   sacred freedoms in the face of violence and intimidation is a
   worthwhile use of an Englishman’s time. There is no more worthwhile use
   of an Englishman’s time than this.

   And at the same time, our politicians sob pathetically into the bottom
   of their whisky tumblers and complain how “young people just aren’t
   interested in politics these days”. Believe me, they are. They’re just
   not interested in politicians these days. If taking a stand against
   violent theocracy and exercising priceless civil liberties in the face
   of danger isn’t demonstrating an interest in politics then nothing is.
   Politicians have demonstrated zero commitment to dealing with or even
   acknowledging the problem of Islamism. Now we have the EDL. They’re far
   from perfect but they’re far better than nothing. As Robinson says, he
   doesn’t want to be leader of the EDL. Who would want death threats? I
   don’t want there to be a need for the EDL. But there is.

   ***

   I imagine some people have become involved with the EDL for the wrong
   reasons, maybe just wanting a ruck every now and then. It’s possible
   that some people who have become involved for the wrong reasons are now
   involved for the right reasons because they’ve been educated along the
   way by Robinson. Remember, people can change. People can learn. People
   can educate themselves on the hoof. Yes, this also applies to white
   working class lads. People awaken politically in all sorts of ways, for
   all sorts of reasons, and the path is not always straightforward or
   sanitised. Not everyone’s political awakening takes place in an Eton
   College dorm room or a Political Science lecture at the London School
   of Economics.

   People dismiss the EDL and Robinson because of their image and because
   of their own snobbery. I admit the image is uncomfortably close to
   skinhead gangs and “Paki-bashing”. Not one decent person in the United
   Kingdom wants a return to nightmare days of fear, segregation and
   violence. But fear, segregation and violence is exactly what Islamism
   has already delivered by the bucketload.

   The problem of image is just a problem of image, it is not one of
   substance. Wearing overpriced Stone Island clobber and going to
   football matches are not crimes in the United Kingdom, yet.

   We can no longer dismiss the many Hindu, Sikh, Jewish, black and LGBT
   supporters of the EDL as mere political PR stunts designed to deflect
   criticism. Are all those people racist thugs? Are all those people
   nothing but easily led fools who have been cynically manipulated by the
   Bond villain Robinson? Do you really think that or do you just really
   want to think that?

   The stakes in the battle against Islamism are incredibly high. They are
   unimaginably high. Every single freedom which is a pre-condition for
   your way of life and which you take for granted on a daily basis is
   currently under sustained attack from Islamism. But that’s fine, let’s
   just wait until someone with a better image comes along, shall we?
   There’s no hurry. After all, what’s the big deal with suicide bombers
   on the London Underground, newspapers self-censoring cartoons of
   prophets through fear of violence, widespread female genital
   mutilation, women and young girls being covered up so they don’t get
   [DEL: blamed for being :DEL] raped, [44]women being treated like dogs
   in Sharia councils, [45]Muslim sex gangs considering non-Muslims “the
   other”, and a British soldier with the name Lee Rigby having his head
   cut off in a London street in the middle of the day while his attacker
   shouts “Allahu Akbar”, allegedly.

   ***

   Phew.

   Tommy, I hope you’re reading this. I’ll direct the remainder of this
   post to you. I have enormous respect for what you’re doing. I beg of
   you to remain as committed to non-violence and opposing racism as you
   are to defeating Islamism.

   I imagine there are two types of people who support the EDL: decent
   people who aren’t racist or violent, and others. It’s vital you root
   out the bad apples and disassociate yourself from them unequivocally,
   or successfully educate them, extremely quickly.

   You were born to do this. You have a gift for communication. I saw you
   talking about Shia/Sunni bloodshed on Twitter the other day and someone
   asked you what that was, and you said, “basically Luton v Watford”.
   That’s the kind of communication skills money just can’t buy. (Did I
   sound like a patronising middle class wanker just then? That’s probably
   because I’m a patronising middle class wanker. But I imagine it makes a
   nice change from the death threats.)

   From what I can see you get grief from pretty much everyone. From
   Islamists, from their hard-left apologists like Unite Against Fascism,
   from their soft-left “liberal” champagne socialist apologists, from
   Middle England, from other people who want to defeat Islamism but who
   won’t touch you because you’re too hot to handle, and even from EDL
   supporters when demos don’t go according to plan and they ask you for
   their money back! Wankers! As you said in one of your videos, after
   demos when other people go back to their normal lives you don’t because
   your life is now a demo. That sent a shiver down my spine.

   Tommy, [46]to quote the apologist George Galloway: I salute your
   courage, your strength, your indefatigability. It’s unfortunate this
   country needs the EDL but it does.

   And the EDL needs you.

   Your friend in Middle England.
