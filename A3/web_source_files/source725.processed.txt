   The [28]Hitman beta for pre-orderers is still a way off for PC players
   (February 19), but a new trailer has appeared that starts to
   answers some questions surrounding Agent 47's new incarnation. The
   beta, rather than being labelled a 'stress test' or the like, is being
   billed as 'the beginning'.

   It's set 20 years in the past at a top secret facility, and will detail
   how Agent 47 joined international murder conglomerate, the ICA. It's
   effectively a discrete episode within [29]the series of Hitman chapters
   to be released.

   Naturally, it'll give Io the chance to test their online content like
   leaderboards and the implementation of new targets, and it'll also
   allow us to get a feel for [30]47's new groove without spoiling the
   one headline map Hitman will launch with. I should note that the
   introductory level will also be present when Hitman releases, so don't
   worry about missing out, although saves won't carry over.

   Hitman's first chapter may be more substantial than we thought.
