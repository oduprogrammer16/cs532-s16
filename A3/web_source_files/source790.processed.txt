8 Insider Tips on Creating an Online Business Marketing Plan

   [29]Business Development By [30]Ken Pickard

   [33]Online Marketing plan Starting an online business part time doesn’t
   have to be a huge obstacle it appears to be. Whether you are facing the
   dreaded website set up or the overwhelm of too much information…your
   dreams of making some extra money are so worth it!

   If you are facing those obstacles then I have some great news for you.
    1. You’re not alone! You can pole 100 successful online business
       builders and each and everyone one can give you some kind of horror
       story of when they got started and what they went through to get
       where they are today.

   Some of my favorite business men and woman, who have created incredible
   businesses, have started with nothing. Or is some cases…less than
   nothing.  You know those rags to riches stories successful we keep
   hearing.

   How this guy was homeless and now has an business that has grossed over
   185 Million in sales. Or how this couple was hundreds of thousands of
   dollars in debt, but in 2 years is worth 10 million.
    2. It is very possible to build a successful online business and the
       right marketing plan can save you months of struggle. The
       difference between most rag to riches and part time marketers is
       their story and hustle.

   Usually the rag to riches crowd had nothing to start with therefore had
   nothing to lose. They could afford to burn 18 hours a day try this or
   that. They could take 3 or 4 months to learn some kind of marketing
   method that would raise their game 10x.

   As a part time marketer the words “I ain’t got time for that” seem to
   ring true. Or does it?

   Could it be possible that a person who is starting a business online
   could achieve the same results as someone who achieved greatness in
   their business by brute force and sheer will power?

   I say undoubtedly YES! But there’s a catch. As there always is right?
   The right mindset is required as well as the right tools and systems.
   Yes you can shrink that learning curve and still build that business
   through a simple model.

   Before we get to the meat and potatoes check out this quick video that
   just crossed my desk. It’s pretty funny and has a good parallel in
   business. See if you can find it.

   nt&autoplay=0&wmode=transparent&autoplay=0&wmode=transparent&autoplay=0
   &wmode=transparent&autoplay=0&player=arpeggio

   Can you relate this to business…or life? It’s like trying to make ends
   meet. Trying to spread $5 where a $50 should go. Try to ovoid running
   out of money before you run out of month.

   Good news…again…

   You’re not alone!

   Great news…

   I’m going to share some steps that you can use as your online business
   marketing plan.


8 Core Steps to for Your Online Business Marketing Plan!

   I did mention that you needed the right mindset, tools and systems
   right? Well here’s part of that not no secret formula. These 8 core
   steps should be used as a guideline or road map to build any business
   part time or full time.

   The first 4 steps are the action steps.

   Core step #1 Get All In

   All in means ALL IN. Mentally, physically, spiritually, financially and
   any other ly word you can think of. It’s the: I’ve burned the boat,
   dank the cool aid, there is no plan B, come hell or high water, even if
   it takes 5 years, I’m doing this with or without you, I got the golden
   ticket, top package.

   It’s the attitude and confidence, mindset and framework all other
   business owners lack who are not all in. Here’s the litmus test…you
   ether figure out how to get it done or you make excuses.

   Bottom line is that you want to be a product of the product. If you
   sell Chevy’s you’re not going to drive a Dodge are you?


   Core Step #2 Blog Daily

   Everyone has a voice and everyone has a story. And whether you are a
   micro blogger on Twitter or a video blogger on Youtube…you have the
   ability to share your story. This may be hard to swallow if you’re new
   but trust me…everyone has a story!

   Additionally blogging helps with many other aspects of your online
   business Examples are
     * Becoming a better writer
     * Making better videos
     * Communicating better
     * Networking, both online and offline
     * Learning and molding your skill sets
     * Personal development
     * Increase creativity and memory

   And the list goes on. Never underestimate the power of blogging! Plus
   it beats out static websites like a million to one as far as social AND
   organic traffic. [35]Need a blog?


   Core Step #3 Market Daily

   After blogging comes marketing and this is where the rubber meets the
   road when it comes to building your brand and followers.

   Trick question…

   Is blogging marketing?

   The answer is NO.

   Marketing, when it comes to your online business, is everything you do
   to get more eye balls to your capture page and then sales page. With
   respect to blogging…it’s everything you do to get people to see your
   blog. That would be syndication of your blog post. Bookmark my
   [36]content syndication checklist

   Some recent articles give way to insights on current marketing trends.
     * [37]Content marketing will be bigger than ever
     * [38]Social Media marketing will require more diversity
     * [39]Image-Centric marketing will rule
     * [40]Mobile friendly content will be necessary
     * [41]Ad Retargeting will grow in effectiveness
     * [42]SEO and social signals will become even more intertwined.

   Now you may be thinking…”OK you had me at blogging but these trends…how
   can I compete with all that?”

   Don’t worry…I got your back on that! More info on that in a minute. In
   fact this is the perfect segue into the next 4 core commitments in your
   online business. And truth be told…I’m pulling these right out of the
   [43]this playbook.

   The next 4 steps are mindset and personal development…in fact they are
   the leadership development process.


   Core Step #4 New Member Coaching

   Starting online business part time

   Remember your very first job?

   I worked at a garden center when I was 15. Besides getting a rude
   awakening with FICA and taxes…I had someone show me what to do. They
   guided me during my first week of all the ins and outs of my job
   duties. I bet you had a similar situation. Someone must have shown you
   how to do your job.

   Starting your own online business is the same deal as starting your
   first job. There should be someone there to give you that initial
   support, encouragement, explain all the how to’s ect. this online
   marketing bushiness plan will do just that.

   When done properly the new member coaching will…
     * Elevate the belief and confidence the new member has in you as
       their sponsor.
     * Raise their belief in the company through your eyes.
     * Raise the confidence within themselves that they are in the right
       place at the right time.
     * Provide them with a simple step by step on exactly what to do next
       in the business.
     * Get to their core desire.
     * Layout a game plan for their business, financially and timeline.
     * Identify their commitment level for their business.
     *

   Core Step #5 Listening to Daily Audio

   Simply put you are already wired for success….right? Of course right!
   It may have been that somewhere down the line “society” may have beaten
   you down some.

   You just may need a little tapping into what we call “[44]Your Best
   Self” to bring that success to life. Look it’s no secret that we get
   bombarded daily from C.N.N (constant negative news) and the creeper
   mindset limitations. The god news is we can take back control and live
   life how it was meant to be…like when we were kids again.

   Think about the time when you were a kid and knew what you wanted and
   you made it happen. There was no limiting beliefs. You learned to crawl
   walk and run. You learned to read and write. You made things happen.

   Somewhere along the route “life happens” and we start to wane.
   Listening to audios in your down time helps build back that muscle
   memory of what it’s like to win, to be successful, to remove doubt.

   The best audios to listen to on a daily basis are ones from people who
   are doing what you want to do. They have achieved what you are setting
   out to achieve. Whether it be personal development, marketing, or
   leadership…stay plugged into what’s working and soon you’ll be living
   it!

   Every successful person on the planet has some kind of support system.
   Listening to audios is one of the cheapest ways of tapping into that
   mastermind groups of successful people.


   [45]leaders are readers Core Step #6 Read Daily

   The perfect combination of; feeding your mind, becoming an expert,
   gaining charisma, and developing your own personal power. Daily audio
   and reading keep you wired for success.

   You’ve heard the phrase…”Leaders are readers.” Many studies have been
   done on common traits of successful people. One of those traits is
   reading. That’s no secret, but a lot of people who are staring their
   online business part time wonder what they should be reading. Here’s a
   few ideas…
     * What’s recommended by successful people.
     * Leadership and success.
     * Mindset and personal development.
     * Successful people’s autobiographies.
     * Fiction…great for tapping into the creative mind.
     * Blogs that are in your niche.

   Bottom line it’s not so much about what you read as it is that you
   read. So get your book on!


   Core Step #7 Weekly Conference Calls

   If you have ever been in sales, or know someone in sales…there is
   always a sales meeting…usually weekly. The sales department is always
   going over facts and figures, short term and long term goals and just
   about anything else.

   This is where the team is plugged in and in your online business a
   weekly call is just the same…and just as powerful.

   The more you stay plugged in the more you stay on top of what’s going
   on. The more you stay “in the know.” The more you hear of the latest
   and greatest information.

   The church gets it. They have you come back every week…twice a week if
   you’re in a bible study. The sales team gets it. Weekly meetings for
   general stuff and special meetings for high end clients. Heck some
   teams have a daily morning meeting to kick off the day.

   The Empower Hour for online marketers is usually your weekly team call.
   Want to be the first to know what’s going on in your company? Be on the
   call!

–> Dial +1 641-715-3602[LIVE] for the EMPOWER HOUR every Monday 9PM EST.

   Core Step #8 Attend The Next Event

   One of the most important core commitments you can make when starting
   an online business is to get the next live event.

   The audios and perfect for you to rewire the brain during downtime.

   The books are perfect for start and or ending your day with information
   you chose.

   The weekly conference calls are great for staying plugged into the
   updates and gleaning some golden nuggets from the leaders.

   But there is nothing like the next live event. Flat out nothing! It’s
   the main event that is put on by either industry professionals and
   trainers or by a company your promoting. The best of the best is always
   delivered at the next event.

   I could write volumes on what it means top get to these events, but I
   leave you with a quick story.

   I was at an event several years ago (by the way you get THE BEST
   stories from events) and a speaker shared this success principal.

   “[47]Be here 1 year from now.”

   Someone asked him then what. He said “Make a new commitment to be here
   a year from now.” He then went on to share that in the last 4 years the
   attendance of the live events doubled almost every year, but those who
   came back year after year were cut in half.

   So after 4 years there was a couple of tables in the back of the
   meeting hall with about 40 people. Each of them had been coming to
   every live event for the past 4 years and the average income was well
   over 100K a year.

   In our online business space every single successful person can
   attribute a shift in their business due to a live event!


   Final thoughts

   Because I only want to build you up for success I’m going to come clean
   and shoot straight now. You are most likely finding yourself in one of
   two camps.

   The first being “Holy cow that’s a lot of work…not sure if I can do
   this.” I’m here to say that you can AND you absolutely deserve it to
   make it work. I first thought the same as you but noticed a shift when
   I started to weed things out of my life that didn’t serve me, like my
   business can. When I did that I realized I had more time to commit to
   the things I needed to do.

   The second camp being “This is the road map I’ve been looking for to
   [48]build my online business thanks for the marketing plan I got this,
   and am ready for it pay me like a full time business should.” I say
   welcome to the new you!

   If you’re in the first camp I would encourage you to look at your
   why…your goals and see if they are worth the fight. There’s nothing
   wrong with staying where you are if you only want to stay comfortable.
   Even if that means paycheck to paycheck.

   But when you’re ready for more…ready to build a life by design and not
   settle for the same ol default life…then you’re ready to step up and
   make that decision that your goals are worth the effort.

   If you’re in the second camp and you know that you know you’re going to
   do whatever it takes, even if you don’t know how just yet…then welcome
   to your new future. The life you want wants you and there’s nothing to
   hold you back.

       EPIC! EPIC!! EPIC Post!!! There’s one line that caught my eye that
       I LOVE the most and that has to do with how to be a success in this
       industry … “Be here next year!”
       Coz here’s the thing … the only way you can fail here … is to quit!
       That’s the only way!
       There are so many success stories all around us to prove that to be
       true!
       Look at David Wood … he stuck around for SEVEN YEARS!!!!!
       Like … OMG!!!!!
       “Be here next year!”
       I LOVE that!!!

            Great story on that post I linked to. It’s crazy to think how
            much of an impact these stories can have on people…if they
            just had the mindset to stick around and see what’s possible.

       This is great. I laughed so hard on the video. I love the 8 core
       committments and you are so right that when we weed out what
       doesn’t serve us and get to the things that do, it all falls into
       place.

       OH EM GEE Ken this is a FANTASTIC POST!! You lay out the steps to
       succeed and WHY you should do them. A lot of people in this
       industry are like little kids in that they don’t just do it, they
       want to know why. Which I guess is a good thing because it
       solidifies the importance of following those steps consistently.
       Kudos!!
