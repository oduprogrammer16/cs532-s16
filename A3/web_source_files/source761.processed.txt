   Detroit — A detention hearing for a Dearborn Heights man suspected of
   supporting Islamic State extremists and planning to “shoot up” a
   Detroit church has been rescheduled for Wednesday.

   Khalil Abu-Rayyan, 21, appeared in federal court Monday afternoon in
   chains and shackles for a hearing on a federal charge of illegally
   possessing a firearm while using a controlled substance. He faces up to
   10 years in a federal prison.

   He has not been charged with terrorism-related crimes.

   The hearing was delayed after Abu-Rayyan informed the court that his
   father has retained Buffalo attorney Thomas Eoannu and needed time to
   get to Detroit, Todd Shanker with the Federal Defender’s Office said.

   U.S. Magistrate Mona Majzoub reset the hearing for 1 p.m. Wednesday.

   “Threats of this nature, regardless of where they originate, or who
   they target, are always taken seriously,” said David P. Gelios, special
   agent in charge of the FBI’s Detroit division, in statement. “The FBI
   acted quickly and comprehensively to investigate and arrest Mr. Rayyan
   upon the receipt of information that he posed a potential public safety
   threat. The investigative actions prior to his arrest included 24/7
   surveillance to ensure there was a prompt response to any attempted
   violent act.”

   In a complaint unsealed Thursday in U.S. District Court reveals the FBI
   has been investigating him since May “regarding increasingly violent
   threats he has made to others about committing acts of terror and
   martyrdom — including brutal acts against police officers, churchgoers
   and others — on behalf of the foreign terrorist organization Islamic
   State of Iraq and Levant.”

   Besides allegedly using Twitter to express support for the terror group
   — often referred to as ISIS or ISIL — Abu-Rayyan reportedly told an
   undercover FBI employee about a plot to target a Detroit church.

   “I tried to shoot up a church one day,” Abu-Rayyan is quoted as saying
   in court records. “I don’t know the name of it, but it’s close to my
   job. It’s one of the biggest ones in Detroit. Ya, I had it planned out.
   I bought a bunch of bullets. I practiced a lot with it. I practiced
   reloading and unloading. But my dad searched my car one day, and he
   found everything. He found the gun and the bullets and a mask I was
   going to wear.”

   Investigators didn’t name the church Abu-Rayyan allegedly eyed, but
   claim the property covers about two blocks less than half a mile from
   his work and can accommodate up to 6,000 members. He allegedly
   purchased a gun and told an undercover FBI employee that attacking a
   church would be “easy.”

   “A lot of people go there. Plus people are not allowed to carry guns in
   church,” the affidavit quotes him as saying. “Plus it would make the
   news. Everybody would’ve heard. Honestly I regret not doing it. (If I)
   can’t go do jihad at the Middle East, I would do my jihad over here.”

   Abu-Rayyan appeared in federal court Thursday, said Gina Balaya, public
   information officer for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Detroit.

   Court records show he was assigned a federal defender, who has not
   responded to a request for comment. Messages left for those listed as
   his relatives were not returned.

   “If the allegations are true, then they’re extremely troublesome,” said
   Dawud Walid, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic
   Relations’ Michigan chapter.

   He said the group is urging caution “and encouraging the broader
   community to also reserve judgment regarding this matter.”

   The court document claims Abu-Rayyan used Twitter for “retweeting,
   liking and commenting” on IS propaganda since late 2014. According to
   the affidavit, the posts included “video of a Jordanian fighter pilot
   being burned alive, men being thrown from a high rise building to
   execute them, the beheading of Christians in Egypt and news of ISIL
   victories.”

   In December, he communicated with an undercover FBI employee through
   social media; during conversations over several weeks, “Abu-Rayyan
   consistently expressed support for ISIL and repeatedly expressed his
   desire to commit a martyrdom operation,” the document read. He also
   said he had an AK-47 with a 40-round magazine like other extremist
   fighters.

   The affidavit says Abu-Rayyan told the undercover FBI employee a
   firearm he bought in October wasn’t suitable “because it only held six
   shots and he would have to keep reloading.”

   The next month, he “tweeted photos of himself firing an AK-47 type and
   AR-15 type rifles at a local firing range”; one was captioned “Sahwat
   hunting,” which authorities said “is a term for Iraqis who oppose
   ISIL.”

   Federal officials said Abu-Rayyan bought a .22 caliber revolver in
   October from a Dearborn Heights sporting goods store but lacked a
   concealed pistol license. On Oct. 7, Detroit police pulled him over for
   speeding; inside the 2001 Buick Century, officers found marijuana.
   Arrested for toting the drug and carrying a concealed weapon,
   Abu-Rayyan was later released on bond.

   On Nov. 15, the same day the pending case denied him the chance to buy
   another pistol, Abu-Rayyan rented a firearm at the firing range
   pictured on Twitter later that month, according to the affidavit.

   Wayne County prosecutors charged him for the gun and marijuana; he
   pleaded guilty to the drug possession Jan. 15 and was scheduled for
   trial Feb. 16 on the weapon charge, authorities said.

   Soon after he pleaded guilty, Abu-Rayyan told the undercover person he
   “wanted to kill the officer who arrested him.” Since the officer’s
   heart attack delayed a trial, Abu-Rayyan “wanted to do a martyrdom
   operation at the hospital, killing the police officer in the process,”
   according to court documents. The next day, he told the undercover FBI
   employee about carrying a “large knife or sword in his car” in case of
   a fight and said “it is my dream to behead someone,” documents allege.

   The case coincides with Muslims in Michigan and nationwide facing
   tensions amid fears about rising extremism in the wake of the recent
   Paris and California attacks.

   “We advise people not to jump to conclusions about what happened and
   wait for all of the facts to come in,” said Muzammil Ahmed, board
   chairman for the Michigan Muslim Community Council. “Our thoughts are
   with our Christian friends and congregation that were threatened. We
   think that isolated acts like this, if they are indeed true, are an
   anomaly in this area.”
