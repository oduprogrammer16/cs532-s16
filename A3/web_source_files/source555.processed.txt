3 Secrets to Funding Success in Startup Tech Companies

Getting funding is one of the biggest hurdles you will ever overcome as a
business, and these three little secrets can help ensure you get what you
need.

   For some entrepreneurs, getting funding is a nightmare. It’s certainly
   stressful and requires a heck of a lot of preparation. Your entire idea
   is often on the line, based on whether your target investors think your
   idea is worth investing in, and if you mess up your presentation you
   might have to start from scratch looking for funding elsewhere.

   There are a lot of different ways to pursue funding for your startup
   tech company, including looking for angel investors, venture
   capitalists, or a crowdfunding campaign, but all of them offer a
   similar platform for your pitch. As a serial entrepreneur, I’ve faced
   my share of challenges getting and keeping funding, and as a result,
   I’ve been able to identify three key secrets in getting the funding you
   need, no matter what the source is:
    1. Have a concise pitch. You need to know your idea inside and out,
       even if you have plans for the next 5-10 years. But you don’t want
       to tell your investors everything at once. The best ideas for
       startups are those that can be effectively described in just one or
       two sentences—so make sure you can be at least that concise.
    2. Care. You won’t get anything from anybody unless you genuinely care
       and are visibly passionate about your ideas. Don’t go overboard
       with expressing your affections, but don’t present cold either.
       Make sure your investors know how passionate and committed you are
       to your ideas.
    3. Have your research done. You’re probably going to face a lot of
       questions from your potential investors, so make sure you know your
       audience, your market, your competitors, and your overall strategy.
       The more well-read you can appear, the better.

   That’s it. Really. If you can be ready with those three secrets to a
   masterful funding pitch, you’ll have just about everything you need to
   get investment capital. Depending on the investor you’re pursuing,
   you’ll have to make some adjustments, and of course you’ll have plenty
   of practicing to do, but the fundamentals always come first.
