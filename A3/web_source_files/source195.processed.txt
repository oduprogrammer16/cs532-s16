Kon Mari Organizing Project #2: Drawers

   in [57]DECOR, [58]ORGANIZATION on 01/02/16

   Hopefully, you have seen my file organization and are here now to see
   my organized drawers!  I was in desperate need of some drawer
   organization particularly in my closet which is where I concentrated my
   time for this post.  I have spent many hours organizing my closet but
   the drawers have always been somewhat of a mess.

   Organizing the Kon Mari Way 3 by www.mylifefromhome.com

   To start, I pulled everything out of my drawers and began to sort.
   Here is a before of my sock drawer which was overflowing.

   Next, after sorting and getting rid of old, worn or not needed items, I
   cleaned out the dust from the drawer and set up my newly purchased
   inserts.  These are a set of drawer organizers that I purchased from
   IKEA.  They open up and can be configured in a variety of ways.

   The next step was to fold the items in the way that was recommended by
   the Kon Mari book.

   Step 1: Lay flat on top of each other

   IMG_4478 IMG_4479

   Step 2: Fold in half

   IMG_4480

   Step 3: One more fold to make a small square

   Step 4: Insert into drawer vertically like little cards

   IMG_4483

   This seems time-consuming, but in reality, it did not take more than an
   extra couple of minutes total and the result was fantastic.

   Not only did it create more room, but you can see everything you have
   in your drawer.  It is neat and organized.

   I tackled my sock and underwear/ bra drawers.  I‚Äôll spare you from
   seeing my undies, but I feel like I‚Äôm shopping at VS every time I open
   my drawer now.  What a great feeling!

   This made a huge difference and I can‚Äôt wait to tackle additional
   drawers in the same way!

To life feeling like home!

XO,
