[77]carsnatcher NM NEMESIS has caught up with two syndicates which
specialized in the hijacking of heavy duty trucks along Benin / Ore
Expressway and the snatching/stealing of posh vehicles in Ondo State.

   Different vehicles and trucks were recovered from the syndicates by
   detectives from the state Police Command.

   Sunday Vanguard gathered that two suspects, Dele Olayemi and Ayo
   Akinde, were leaders of one of the syndicates which specialized in
   stealing cars parked by owners.

   The other syndicate, which specialized in the hijacking of heavy duty
   trucks and petrol tankers, was said to have been coordinated by four
   suspects, namely: Sunday Olufemi, Idowu Omowole, Ebenezer Onos and
   Akeem Mayama,

   All the suspects who have allegedly made confessional statements are in
   police detention.

   Over 11 different vehicles were recovered from the first syndicate
   while 14 were taken from the other group.

   Speaking with Sunday Vanguard, the leader of the syndicate that
   allegedly snatched posh cars, Moses Olayemi, said he went into the
   business to make money so as to build a house.

   “ My father married three wives and he refused to send us to school. I
   only went to primary school.

   “ I have been able to buy a land and what I am looking for is money to
   start the building after which I want to marry. “

   Some of my friends introduced me into this business of snatching and
   stealing of cars,”he stated.

   When asked how many vehicles he had stolen, he said he could only
   remember the number of those he stole in the last 11 months.

                                 [INS: :INS]

   “ I can only remember that over 11 different cars were snatched and
   stolen where the owners parked them by my gang in the last 11months.
   “The receiver of the stolen vehicles, one Omo Ode, used to buy the
   vehicles for between N80,000 and N140,000.” Dele explained that the
   dealer usually changed the number plate and other parts of the vehicle
   before selling to unsuspected buyers.

   “ We sold any jeep or posh car that we stole for N140, 000 while we
   sold smaller cars, whether new or old, for N80,000. “When we stole a
   car, we will remove its number and register it with a new one.

   “We would change some parts of the vehicle so that the owner would not
   be able to identify it because most of the cars are being used in
   Akure, the state capital”

   The suspect, however, wondered why the dealer, popularly called
   ‘Oluomo’, who usually bought the stolen vehicles from them, was not
   arrested alongside them.

   On how he stole vehicles, he said, “ I will enter the market, buy
   ignition key. I will use the key to test the car. If it starts, I will
   take the vehicle away; if not, I will leave it and run away.”

   Sunday Vanguard gathered that Dele ran out of luck when, at gun point,
   in front of UBA, in Akure, he snatched a Nissan Almera car.

   Detectives swung into action after the matter was reported to the
   police and the car was later recovered at Oba Akoko area of the state
   with many of its parts replaced.

   Ondo State Police Commissioner Mike Ogbodu said the suspects would soon
   be charged to court.
