   of circulation - but only after being picked up on social media

   As unfortunate typos go it could have hardly been worse.

   The Republic of Ireland is currently a few days into a [63]general
   election campaign that is taking place amid the backdrop of the
   hundredth anniversary of the [64]Easter 1916 rising.

   In one campaign leaflet, Mary Lou McDonald, the deputy leader of Sinn
   Fein - the fourth-biggest party in the last Irish parliament - wanted
   to be quoted invoking the spirit of one of the figureheads of the Irish
   Republican movement, [65]Bobby Sands, the IRA hunger striker who
   starved himself to death in the Maze Prison in Northern Ireland in
   1981.

   However, somewhere along the way Bobby became Booby and nobody noticed
   until the leaflets were printed and were starting to be distributed.
   Not surprisingly the error has caused some amusement and awful punning
   on social media.

   The writer Paddy Duffy referenced the [66]historical ties between the
   IRA and Eta, the Basque separatist group, in his post.

   One person who is not so amused is Ms McDonald, who is one of the most
   recognisable faces in Irish politics. She has not responded well to
   some of the tweets and memes being circulated in response to the typo -
   including by an account attributed to a member of the youth wing of the
   ruling Fine Gael party. Dan McInereny photoshopped Ms McDonald's head
   onto a gif of the actor Matt LeBlanc from an episode of the TV series
   Friends in which he was buried up to his neck on a beach and given a
   sandy cleavage.

   Ms McDonald dismissed this as [67]"gurrier" politics - gurrier being
   Dublin slang for a hooligan - and accused her detractors of "scraping
   the barrel". But she has received some sympathy, however, including
   from a fellow politician north of the border - a member of the Irish
   nationalist party, the SDLP.

   A Sinn Fein spokesperson told BBC Trending: "The leaflet was
   commissioned and printed by a local area [printers]. It contained a
   typo that should never have been printed or distributed. The leaflet
   has been withdrawn."
