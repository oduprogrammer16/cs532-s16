Can U.S. stocks still return 5% in 2016?

   by [88]Heather Long   [89]@byHeatherLong February 8, 2016: 1:49 PM ET

   bear bull stock market

"Is it realistic to expect a 5% to 7% return on stocks in 2016 or should I
lower my hopes?" asks CNNMoney reader Harold Hughes of Cotuit, MA.

   Short answer: Lower your hopes.

   Stocks are off to a brutal start in 2016. Nearly all investors are[90]
   losing money. The U.S. market has [91]shed about 10%. Tech stocks are
   getting hammered even more.

   Welcome to the era of diminished stock market expectations. Nearly
   every Wall Street firm has slashed predictions for how stocks will
   perform in 2016.

   Heading into this year, there was a lot of optimism. The U.S. economy
   looked strong. Hiring was up and the belief was people would go out and
   buy more stuff and that would drive growth.

   As recently as mid-December, the average prediction for stocks in 2016
   was a[92] whopping 9% gain.

   Now experts say we'll be "lucky" to get 4% to 5%. It hinges on U.S.
   consumers continuing to spend.

   China and oil are pulling global stocks down

   "I wouldn't rule out 5%, but I think anything more than that is more
   hope than I'm comfortable with at the moment," says Brad McMillian,
   chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial.

   McMillian is one of many experts who has cut his forecast. He now
   predicts the [94]S&P 500 will end the year at 2,050. That's barely
   higher from where it started.

   Basically, the world economy belly flopped at the start of the year.
   The Chinese tinkered with their currency again, which was interpreted
   as another warning sign that the second biggest economy in the world is
   slowing faster than feared.

   The pullback in China is spreading rapidly around the world. While the
   U.S. has been largely unscathed, the reality is no economy is an island
   anymore.

   On top of that, oil[95] fell to a 13-year low and the U.S. dollar
   [96]keeps surging, making it tricky for American companies doing
   business abroad.

   [97]Related: Why China doesn't know what it's doing

   A recession is still a slim possibility

   Investors have sold stocks as they bet that companies, even in the
   U.S., just can't grow a lot more in a world that is going through what
   Apple CEO Tim Cook [98]recently described as "extreme conditions."

   The question now is how bad it will get. Fears of a global -- and even
   U.S. -- recession are rising, although the probability of that worst
   case scenario happening is still [99]only about 20%.

   "I don't think we'll see a collapse here. The economic conditions don't
   seem to be in place," says McMillan. He believes the market is pricing
   in too much doom and gloom.

   [100]Related: Why doesn't 4.9% unemployment feel great?

   So what should an investor do?

   So what should an investor like Harold Hughes do?

   "What I would say to an investor now is: Don't focus on this year
   alone," says Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at Northern Trust
   Wealth Management.

   Over every 15 year period since World War II, the U.S. stock market has
   [101]made money for investors (often A LOT of money). Sticking in
   stocks pays off.

   Northern Trust Wealth Management is forecasting a 4% to 7% return for
   stocks over the next five years.

   "That may not sound like a lot, but it's coming off a period where
   we've had above-average returns," notes Nixon.

   [102]Related: U.S. economy still healthy, says key Fed official

   Investors who feel queasy should talk to their financial adviser and
   make sure they still have a good long-term strategy for their
   retirement or other goals. It also makes sense in an environment like
   this to look for so called "Blue Chip" American stocks -- big,
   well-known companies that pay dividends.

   While stock prices may not go up much this year, many companies are
   still paying their dividends. That helps to boost returns. Consider
   this: last year, the S&P 500 index lost 0.7%. BUT it actually gained
   1.2% if your dividends were reinvested (which most "buy and hold"
   investors do).

   "To say we're not going to get rich in equities doesn't mean they're
   not a good place to be," says McMillian.
