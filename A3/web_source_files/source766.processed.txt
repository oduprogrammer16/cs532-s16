   Story: 10/10
   Straight from the ingenious mind of Michiko Yokote, an often overlooked
   script writer who had a hand or two in critically acclaimed works such
   as Naruto, Bleach, Blood + and even Junjou Romantica among other
   things- It's easy to see why Sekkou Boys is arguably one of the best,
   if not THE best deconstruction of the Idol genre to date.
   Sekkou boys masterfully juggles its nuanced themes and polished content
   with a succinct and easy to follow narrative, detailing the struggle of
   aspiring rookie Idol manager Ishimoto Miki, and the trials she
   encounters as she attempts to rid herself of the prejudice
   preconception that statues can't be idols, and ultimately; overcome
   these flaws to become a grounded individual with a strong understanding
   of what she wants to achieve in life and how she wants to achieve it.
   Predominately, Sekkou Boys seeks to explore the inner workings of the
   idol industry, the growing gap between how Idols act on stage to how
   they act in reality, and the publicity issues and identity confusion
   that can result in, and to a lesser but still notable extent, themes of
   what it means to be human.
   I can appreciate that the religious imagery and symbolism sprinkled
   throughout the series can sometimes be rather jarring, but the backlash
   the show receives as a result fails to acknowledge that these are just
   details incorporated for additional flavour for those who care to
   notice.
   It's no secret that Sekkou Boys is often, somewhat insultingly, likened
   as the "pocket edition" of other deconstructions such as Madoka Magica
   and Love Live School Idol Project, but I strongly encourage this
   unhealthy comparison to be avoided, for what Sekkou Boys lacks in
   length, It makes up for with....length ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
   Symbolically, Sekkou Boys's length can also be seen to reflect the fact
   that, canonically, the boys have no bodies- demonstrating that even
   without bodies, the boys have pure hearts; in the same way that despite
   being a short, Sekkou boys is an indisputable modern-age masterpiece
   and instant classic.
   Others wouldn't hesitate to suggest it's a subtle commentary on the
   increasing redundancy of the male chromosome.
   Art: 10/10
   Anime is an often controversial medium due to what some would call a
   "stagnation" in the industry's ability to allow animators, script
   writers and directors to have creative freedom, instead forced to
   produce the same monotonous slew of dull uninspired vn adaptations over
   and over again.
   Sekkou Boys manages to break from this trend rather aptly, although
   many seem to ignore this due to the political propaganda that Sekkou
   Boys is racist, with the majority of its cast being the same shade of
   sterile, foreign to sunlight shade of white, I quite frankly don't buy
   into this, but I'm willing to do more research into the matter.
   Characters: 10/10
   From the astute, soul-penetrating, boner inducing glare of Saint
   George, the serene grace and tranquillity that emanates from Hermes, to
   the pussy pillaging pioneer that is Medici- Sekkou Boys has a lot to
   offer in the character department, with no shortage of cute anime idol
   boys who give it their all on stage and try their best to make the
   world happy.
   While I can't ignore or deny the ongoing controversy Mars has sprouted
   with his implied fascist agenda, I at least feel that, to some extent,
   it testifies some of the complexities that can be appreciated in the
   Sekkou boys meta narrative.
   Sound: 10/10
   Having provided his contribution to the soundtracks of the Monogatari
   series, Madoka Magica, and just about every KyoAni show in existence
   and with over 150 shows under his belt, the general consensus is that
   Tsuruoka Yota is finally at the peak of his sound directing career with
   Sekkou Boys, offering an abundant selection of Idol songs that cover a
   variety of genres that are sure to be appreciated by Idol-savvy
   veterans and those that are new to the genre alike.
   Pros:
   +S
   +E
   +KK
   +O
   +B-O-Y-S
   +SEKKO
   Cons:
   +Mars promotes war, which while a subversion, is uncharacteristic of
   Idols and unfair on the audience.
   Overall:
   Sekkou Boys is ambitious, engaging and willing to take risks, with a
   firm grasp on how to execute its lovingly crafted narrative, portraying
   its characters in a realistic but satirical light and despite its
   controversial reception, effortlessly ranks as one of the best of the
   Idol genre, perhaps even the best of the medium in general, or, it
   wouldn't even be too far-fetched to say it may be one of the greatest
   achievements in recent, no, all of mankind's history. [108]read more

   Are you into hard idols? Well this is the show for you.
   So far this show have archived something that any other idol shows
   couldn`t do and that is being entertaining.
   Story
   Is not really complicated it pretty much tells the hardships that these
   idols deal in their everyday lives.
   Art
   Don`t expect to be mindblown with the art is not that great.
   Sound
   You only get to hear the ending so don't watch this anime expecting
   these idols to sing a new song in every episode.
   Character
   Now this is what makes the show for me. Is the interaction between the
   manager and the 4 idols what makes this comedy.
   Overall this is the most aesthetically pleasing show that I have ever
   lay my eyes on, if you wish to watch these idols have a hard time I
   recommend you to start watching the show NOW.
   And if you are into ripped guys showing their nipples you can get
   plenty of action in this show.

   So this is my first review.
   Sekkou boys is a strange show. I haven't seen something similar in my
   life.
   It's refreshing and doesn't make sense, that's why I enjoy this .
   Story: 7
   The story follows four marble sculptures of ancient personalities who
   want to become idols and their manager, a young female.
   Art:6
   The art isn't great, but isn't bad either. I like the way Sekkou Boys
   are designed. They look realistic and that makes the show more funny in
   my opinion. They look exactly like the real ones. Just google them .
   Sound:6
   Now the sound.. this is an idol anime, but at this point in time I
   haven't heard them singing. I was dissapointed. Maybe in future, who
   knows?
   The voice actors made a good job, but I wanted Ishimoto to have a more
   mature voice. I think this could fit her much more.
   The ending song is ok-ish, I listened it 2 times.
   Characters: 8
   The characters are very good, I think they will make you smile if you
   decide to watch SB . This is what makes this anime out of the box:
   Mars- the God of War in Roman religion
   St. George - soldier in the Roman army
   Hermes - The Messenger of the gods, god of trade, thieves, etc. in
   Greek religion and mythology
   (Giuliano De') Medici - co-ruler of Florence in 14th century
   Miki Ishimoto - their hard-working and amusing manager.
   Enjoyment:6
   I enjoy this, but not at the point to want to rewatch it or convince
   other people to watch it because is something wow. Just give it a try.
   The episodes are 8 minutes long .
   Maybe you will find this annoying or boring or Very funny and stunning.
   I have no clue.
   Overall 6.6-7
   I'm waiting for more episodes to came out. There is a high possibility
   for my score to change.
   *English isn't my native language. Sorry if I misspelled some words or
   some phrases doesn't make sense.

   Unconventional series, both of which allude to Ancient Rome in some
   way.
   Thermae Romae's premise is a time travelling Roman exploring Japanese
   bath culture and Sekkou Boys is about animate plaster-casts of famous
   sculptures living as idols in modern Japan. Just look at that perfect
   complementation. Watch both.
