Story highlights

     * Some previous Obama voters say they're drawn to Trump
     * N.H. voter: 'We don't need hope and change'

   Farmington, New Hampshire (CNN)Eight years after they drew inspiration
   from [110]Barack Obama's insurgent campaign, some of the very voters
   who helped elect the first African-American president are standing
   behind a candidate whose image and message are strikingly
   different:[111] Donald Trump.

   Obama campaigned on themes of hope and change; Trump declared in his
   June announcement speech that the American Dream was dead. Obama called
   on the country to shed racial divisions; some of Trump's biggest
   applause lines are his pledge to build a wall on the Mexican border and
   ban Muslim immigration. Obama is a gifted orator with a cool and
   intellectual demeanor; Trump is an improviser with a knack for dramatic
   flair.

   But at Trump's rallies in New Hampshire days ahead of the
   first-in-the-nation primary, it's not too difficult to find ex-Obama
   supporters in the crowds. These individuals say they are once again
   drawn to the promise of change. But the version they're seeking now is
   grounded less on optimistic idealism, and more on something harder and
   angrier: sheer strength and force of will.

   Gary Chagnon, a machinist from Barnstead, voted for Obama in both 2008
   and 2012. He recently submitted an absentee ballot for Trump, and said
   he was drawn to Trump's slogan, "Make America Great Again."

   "We don't need hope and change," Chagnon, 50, said. "We need somebody
   with a set of balls, so to say."

   Chagnon's wife, Annette, also supported the President twice, and this
   time plans to vote for Trump. A 51-year-old working in the shipping
   industry, Annette said she doesn't feel the country is safe and cast
   blame on Obama.

   "He's a little too lax on our borders. I don't think he's paid enough
   attention to that and it contributes to us having homegrown people
   coming in and killing us," she said. "I don't like it and I like that
   Trump is right on that."

Sizable lead for Trump

   Trump has a sizable lead in New Hampshire ahead of Tuesday's primary.
   [122]A CNN/WMUR poll released on Sunday found that 33% of likely
   Republican voters say they'll back Trump, giving him a 17-point edge.

   The support Trump is drawing from independents and even voters who have
   tended to vote for Democrats in the past exemplifies the
   non-traditional nature of the real estate mogul's campaign. And that
   support could prove to be critical for Trump here in a state with an
   outsized bloc of independent voters.

   Democrats, announced his run in an email to supporters on April 30. He
   has said the United States needs a "political revolution" of
   working-class Americans to take back control of the government from
   billionaires.
   "This great nation and its government belong to all of the people and
   not to a handful of billionaires, their super PACs and their
   lobbyists," Sanders said at a rally in Vermont on May 26.

   Many independent voters who supported Obama in 2008 quickly turned on
   him after he took office, frustrated over the state of the economy and
   in many cases disenchanted by Obama's signature health care law. After
   winning 52% of independents in the [130]2008 general election, Obama
   trailed Mitt Romney among independents [131]four years later, 45% to
   50% (Obama won New Hampshire both cycles).

   In the final stretch of Obama's two-term tenure in the White House,
   national security concerns, including the threat of ISIS and the flow
   of undocumented immigrants and refugees into the country, are
   increasingly pronounced.

   Americans are now more likely to say that terrorists are winning the
   war against the United States than at any point since the September 11,
   2001, attacks, a [133]CNN/ORC poll showed in December.

   Amid heightened concern about national security, voters are looking for
   not only a change in direction but also a shift in tone. Trump, with
   his no-apologies attitude and brash rhetoric, is appealing to those
   desires.

   Chris Hickey, a retired Army veteran from Wolfeboro, is an independent
   who voted for Obama in 2008 and Romney in 2012. This year, he's most
   likely to vote for Trump, whom Hickey called a "no nonsense" candidate.

'A little rough around the edges'

   "He's a little rough around the edges at times but I think he'll do a
   good job," he said. "One of the things I don't like about President
   Obama -- he's always apologizing, it seems to me, for the United
   States. And I don't think Trump will do those things."

   The sentiment isn't limited to New Hampshire.

   Jeff Heiden, a Trump fan from Marshalltown, Iowa, said Obama was the
   first Democrat he ever voted for in a presidential election.

   "He was different and he had a lot of good ideas and it sounded like he
   could make some changes in Washington, D.C.," said Heiden, 58. "I
   regretted voting for him so the second time around I voted for Romney."

   In Iowa last week, Trump was the favorite among GOP caucusgoers for
   whom the top quality in a presidential candidate was the ability "bring
   change" to the country (33% of them voted for Trump), according to
   [135]exit polls. He also performed best among caucusgoers whose first
   priority is that a candidate "tells is like it is" (an overwhelming 66%
   of these people backed Trump).

   Trump was one of the three top GOP candidates among self-proclaimed
   independents participating in the GOP caucuses in Iowa: 22% supported
   Trump and another 22% supported Rubio, while 19% chose Cruz.

   "It's called leadership. Mr. Trump's support transcends traditional
   boundaries because he has a vision and a strong message that
   resonates," said Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. "Mr. Trump
   is a uniter and has the ability to bring people together with his
   common sense solutions."

   Bill Hillsman, a political consultant who has worked with many
   independent candidates, said the most defining characteristic of
   independent voters is that "they hate the status quo and believe huge
   change is needed."

   "Obama isn't that much different from Trump. He was promising big
   change, he managed to look like an outsider and a fresh face, and he
   got people to believe in him, not just in what he was promising
   issues-wise and policy-wise," Hillsman said. "Many of these
   independents now see in Trump what they wanted Obama to provide. The
   Donald is most definitely outside the system, yet people feel like they
   know him."

Inspiration turns to disappointment

   When retired elementary school teacher Joan Chase casts her ballot for
   Trump this year, it will be the first time that the 70-year-old has
   ever voted for a Republican. She voted for Obama in both 2008 and 2012.

   At a recent Trump rally in Farmington, Chase said the immense
   inspiration she once felt watching the president soured over the years,
   turning into irreversible disappointment.

   "I thought he was the hope, only to find out he's not carried through
   with what he led people to believe," she said. "He seems to be just
   undecided and I don't know -- weak."

   Her partner Harry Harrison, a Vietnam veteran who also voted twice for
   the president, interjected from beside her to criticize Obama's "hopey,
   changey thing." Unlike Chase, Harrison has largely supported Republican
   candidates in his life — the only other Democrat he ever backed for
   president was John F. Kennedy. Trump, he said, is the country's "last
   hope."

   "I feel totally betrayed," Harrison said of Obama. "If we don't see a
   Trump in this Oval Office, I don't think this country will survive to
   see another election as the country we knew it and the country I fought
   for."
