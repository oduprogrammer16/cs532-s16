User Bio

   Cathy Beggan is the owner of the successful Rise-N-Shine, LLC, a
   nutritional supplements manufacturer and retailer located in Sparta,
   New Jersey. Cathy is an inventor in the classical sense, addressing
   needs and putting her mind to solving the underlying issues. Her
   fertile imagination has led to the creation of over 30 health and
   nutrition supplements, each one designed to tackle everyday problems in
   a way that is healthy and beneficial to users. She has worked with many
   experts in the field of nutritional supplements to develop her
   revolutionary products. Cathy believes strongly in supporting fellow
   American businesses, and everything her company makes is manufactured
   in the United States. During the course of her work developing
   innovative healthcare products, Cathy has been awarded six patents.

   Cathy Beggan earned a Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration from
   William Paterson University of New Jersey in 1993. After graduation,
   Cathy went to work in a number of industries, including the aerospace
   field, detective agencies, and business management in retail
   establishments. In 2006, she decided to tackle the problems that people
   face every day when getting out of bed in the morning. Cathy carefully
   applied the talents she had honed over many years in business
   management, and combined them with the inventor spirit she has become
   known for. Her first patent was awarded in March, 2008, and was related
   to a supplement that helped users wake up refreshed.

   As if managing a successful online company wasn’t enough, Cathy found
   the time to host a weekly Internet radio broadcast entitled “So…You
   Think You Can Host?” On the show, contestants were able to compete for
   a chance to win a radio hosting contract of their own, and the
   listening audience participated by voting for their favorite
   candidates. Cathy’s engaging personality and passion for her work has
   made her highly sought-after by news outlets and lifestyle media
   organizations, helping position her at the forefront of the nutritional
   supplements industry.

   The correct pronunciation of Vimeo is "Vim-ee-oh." Think of it like
   "video" with a "me" in the middle.

   Widgets are nifty tools that make it easy to publish and watch videos
   on other sites. [94]Create a Widget.
