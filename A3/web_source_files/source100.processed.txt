15/02/2016 – London, United Kingdom – Media caught lying over Cologne mass
rapes

   Apologies for the lack of updates today, but Breitbart London has been
   busy exposing the lies in the mainstream media about the Cologne mass
   rapes, sexual assaults and thefts. The Huffington Post, the Metro,
   Russia Today, and the Independent have all claimed that only three
   recent migrants to Germany were involved in Cologne. German prosecutor
   Ulrich Bremer has taken the unprecedented step of coming out and
   calling theses reports “total nonsense” after his words in a German
   interview were twisted by left-wing outlets in the English-speaking
   world. [30]READ MORE HERE.

   these young people into our society, the new attackers of tomorrow
   could soon come from the group of young refugees.”

13/02/2016 – Hannover, Germany – Rapist shouted ‘Inshallah!’

   year old Algerian migrant has appeared in court after DNA testing
   identified him as the rapist.

   Baghdad.

   Travel agent Muhiadin Hassan [34]told Reuters: “Some say they don’t
   like the food here, it’s too cold or they don’t feel welcome in
   Finland. There are many reasons.” He said he is now selling 15 to 20
   tickets to Baghdad each day.

   imprisonment, stalking and one count of inciting a 15-year-old boy to
   engage in sexual activity, the Evening Standard has [36]reported.

   the brutal strangulation and rape of a woman in North London.

13/02/2016 –BONN, Germany – Newly arrived migrant is already repeat offender

   An Algerian migrant who has been in Germany just two months has already
   been caught stealing three times, and has been now [38]sentenced to six

   The court heard the wife had wanted a divorce from her abusive husband.
   The sleeveless dress was found cut up at the scene of the murder, and
   an academic testified the mutilation of the body bore hallmarks of
   having been a ritualised honour killing. Mr. Edil will serve 18 years,
   [40]reports Aftonbladet.

   are investigating politically motivated violence and grievous bodily
   harm, and are appealing for witnesses.

12/02/2016 –HAMBURG, Germany – Englishman raped with courgette

   An Englishman out cycling in a German park was hospitalised on Monday
   evening after he was jumped by a gang of three “southerners” and anally
   raped. MOPO [42]reports the man was dragged to the ground, pinned down,
   and had his trousers pulled down by two of the men while the third went

resisting

   A masked man speaking bad German with a “foreign” accent demanded sex
   from a 19 year old woman as she walked home last week, squeezing her
   chest and buttocks while threatening her with a gun.

   at her as she went away with the so-called airsoft gun, leaving her
   with an injured earlobe and a ball-bearing stuck in her skull bone,
   [43]reports NQOnline. The perpetrator was seen again later threatening
   patrons in a restaurant hotel and despite being captured on CCTV was
   not caught by police.

11/02/2016 –OFFENBURG, Germany – Passer-by beaten after he comes to aid of
sex victim

   A young woman was [44]attacked by a gang of three “Mediterranean
   appearance” men on Sunday morning, and cried out for help. Luckily for
   her a passer-by came to her aid, but the gang then vented their
   frustration at being interrupted on him instead while the girl fled.

   The man then became a victim, being beaten before the gang fled. He
   later bumped into the same gang and was again beaten. Police are
   appealing for witnesses.

   reach police, who are appealing for witnesses.

10/02/2016 –VIENNA, Austria – Extra measures to secure southern border

   Austria’s government is set to [46]announce ten new ‘border management
   systems’ to secure its southern border crossings in Tyrol and
   Carinthia, a place where migrants faced with stricter controls at the
   border with Slovenia are likely to cross.

   The measures will include fences, barriers and increased patrols by
   police and soldiers. There will also be army patrols on Austria’s
   border with Hungary, the main crossing point for migrants last summer.
     __________________________________________________________________

10/02/2016 –Austria – Asylum seekers jump the hospital queue

   Last week large numbers of people turned up at Austrian hospitals
   because of a flu epidemic, but had to wait to see doctors whilst asylum
   seekers were seen to get priority treatment. Now health officials have
   [47]admitted they were ordered not to make asylum seekers wait but to
   give them fast track treatment.

   The reason given is that part of the asylum process sees migrants
   receiving a health check for which expensive translators are needed to
   aid communication with doctors, and Austrian officials do not want to
   pay translators to sit in waiting rooms.

10/02/2016 –ERFURT, Germany – Two 14 year old girls harassed

   Four Afghan men, aged 16, 17, 21, and 29 were taken into police custody

   [49]reports Morgenweb.
     __________________________________________________________________

10/02/2016 –GÜTERSLOH, Germany – Carnival chaos, rape, sex assault

   A town’s annual carnival has been overshadowed by sex assault and
   theft, [50]reports Neue Westfalische. A 24 year old presented herself
   to police after she was raped, leading to the arrest of a 29 year old
   Nigerian asylum seeker. The man told police the sex was consensual,
   investigations are ongoing.

   she was dancing at a Shrovetide celebration on Sunday. After one
   attacked her and turned to leave, she was held back by a second while
   being mocked by the men. On the same day a number of other women
   between 18 and 21 years old were also molested, being touched on the
   bottom, breasts, and genitals by three Arab men.

     __________________________________________________________________

10/02/2016 – DORTMUND, Germany – Migrant on migrant violence

   A 38 year old Moroccan ‘refugee’ was rushed to intensive care from his

09/02/2016 – LEVERKUSEN, Germany – Mass brawl after migrant teenage sex
assault

   Dozens of locals moved to defend a 19 year old girl after she was
   groped on bottom by a “North African” male which led to a mass brawl.
   Police were deployed to the suburb and ordered all bars in the area to
   close early to head off the possibility of further violence. The
   violence, in which migrants pulled knives after being told to leave the
   local women alone, took three hours to be settled by officers.

   Local bar owners expressed frustration over being forced to close early
   on one of their busiest trading days of the year, with one landlord
   [55]expressing to the Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger that the crowd in her
   establishment were good natured and they had nothing to do with the
   fighting.

09/02/2016 – ROME, Italy – Merkel made angry phone call to Pope

   Pope Francis has revealed he was rebuffed by the German Chancellor
   after he made remarks in 2014 comparing Europe to a “barren woman”,
   making a clear attack on the failure of native Europeans to sustain
   their own populations. The low birthrate of most European nations has
   been a major contributing factor to the justification of mass
   migration.

   Speaking in an interview the Pontiff remarked: “She was a bit angry
   because I had compared Europe to a barren woman, incapable of producing
   children”, [56]reports euobserver. Read more about Europe’s falling
   [57]birthrate at Breitbart London.

   smugglers could barely sail. The attempt was thwarted by military
   police carrying out a spot check.

09/02/2016 – Norway – Children raped in migrant centres

   Under-18 migrants living in Norwegian asylum centres are being sexually
   abused, with the criminal investigation police admitting they have no
   idea how deep the problem runs, [60]reports Klassekampen. The children
   are not just being raped and assaulted by their fellow asylum
   inhabitants, but the centres are being visited by known sex offenders.

09/02/2016 – BRUSSELS, Belgium – EU thinks twice about migrant plan

   European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker’s flagship plan to stem
   Europe’s migration crisis by redistributing refugees around the bloc
   risks crumbling as EU states balk at sharing the burden, diplomats,
   officials and experts have told [61]AFP.
     __________________________________________________________________

09/02/2016 – AMSTERDAM, Netherlands – Dutch set up border controls

   The Netherlands has stepped up the monitoring of traffic crossing its
   frontiers, a government minister said on Monday. The move follows a
   decision last September to deploy mobile border guard units along roads
   and railways lines to intercept migrants and separate them from asylum
   seekers, Reuters has [62]reported.

   “Those measures helped, but we were still seeing a rising number of
   smugglers being arrested, and you are seeing more people coming from
   safe countries, who aren’t eligible for asylum,” state secretary Klaas
   Dijkhoff told reporters.

09/02/2016 – ESSEX, England – Seven arrested at Indian restaurant

   Seven have been arrested after an immigration raid at an Indian
   Tandoori in Stanway, Essex. Two of the illegal workers attempted to
   flee officers as they stormed the building but were detained,
   [63]report the Gazette News. Four men will be deported.

09/02/2016 – CALAIS, France – Railway station smashed

   A migrant was seen smashing every screen on a platform at Calais rail
   station this week before boarding a train. He was reported to the
   police by others at the station, and was arrested upon arrival at
   Lille, according to a [64]report by local group Les Calaisiens en
   Colère on Facebook.

08/02/2016 – MAINZ, Germany – Suspected ISIS commander raided

   German police have raided a “picturesque” village near Mainz, acting on
   intelligence that one of the ‘refugees’ who had been housed there was a
   senior and experienced Islamic State officer. Spiegel [65]reports the
   man in question is a “notorious” commander responsible for the death of
   “dozens” of people who escaped to Europe with tens of thousands of
   dollars in cash.

08/02/2016 – KOS, Greece – Mayor warns migrant crisis fermenting civil unrest

   The mayor of the Greek island of Kos on Sunday called on the government
   to abandon its plans to build a migrant registration centre as demanded
   by the EU, warning that local opposition could lead to “uncontrollable”
   protests. “There is a present danger that we will mourn victims and be
   led to uncontrollable situations,” Kos mayor Yiorgos Kyritsis said in a
   letter to Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, made public by the state
   agency ANA.

   Three locals were hurt this week in a scuffle with riot police near the
   area chosen to build the migrant centre, or hotspot, including a
   journalist covering the protest, who was later detained. AFP

08/02/2016 – BUDAPEST, Hungary – Hungary applauds border controls

   Hungary, the south-eastern European nation which reduced daily illegal
   migrant border crossings from 10,000 a day to just a couple of dozen by
   building a patrolled razorwire fence has congratulated Austria on
   making the first steps of securing their own border,
   [66]reports Frankfurter Allgemeine.

   Austria had been last year the strongest critic of Hungary’s border
   plan, with some government figures even comparing the Hungarian
   government to Nazis for taking efforts to protect their borders.
   Hungarian leader Viktor Orban was last week [67]presented with a gift
   painting by the people of Bulgaria to congratulate him on his efforts
   to protect Europe from Muslim mass migration.

08/02/2016 – MEININGEN, Germany – Police investigating migrant themed
carnival float

   [68]Express Details of a mocked up wooden train carnival float which is
   thought to be making reference to the efficiency with which European
   railways have brought hundreds of thousands of migrants into the heart
   of the continent has been passed to the prosecutor for investigation.

   The locomotive, which was aptly named the ‘Balkan Express’ and had
   [69]written across the buffer bar “The Plague is Coming” was
   accompanied by dozens of carnival committee members dressed as
   grasshoppers. The prosecutor will decide whether the display was a hate
   speech, or if it comes under the category of carnival satire.

08/02/2016 – CALAIS, France – Migrants Barricade Eurostar Terminal

   Migrants completely blockaded the Eurotunnel access road last night
   with wooden pallets and debris in a bid to stop traffic moving and

   Seven people have been arrested in Spain suspected of supplying arms
   and bomb making equipment to Islamic State and the al-Qaeda affiliated
   Jabhat al-Nusra organisations in Iraq and Syria. Four are Spanish
   nationals of Syrian, Jordanian and Moroccan origin; two others are
   Spanish residents from Syria and Morocco. Along with the men, police
   seized cash, electronics equipment and bomb-making materials disguised
   as humanitarian aid, the Daily Mail has [71]reported.

   The arrests bring the total number of alleged jihadists arrested in
   Spain since the beginning of 2015 to 82.

migrants

   The governor of Upper Austria is deploying the state undercover police
   force to deal with what he described as a “small group of Moroccans”
   who he says are “fueling the rejection of all refugees” with their
   criminality.

   The move is in response to the city train station having become a
   “danger zone” with fights every day and passengers going to and from
   trains routinely “molested”, [72]reports Kronen Zeitung.

08/02/2016 – ALTENBERG, Germany – Carnival float warns of dark future

   [73]Native Indians A carnival float in the Saxony town of Altenberg has
   grabbed the attention of many German newspapers after it depicted a
   native American tipi. Written on a board below the wigwam and followed
   by the carnival crew dressed as native Americans, was the legend: “The
   Indians did nothing to prevent immigration and today they live in
   reservations”.

   A second picture from the same parade showed a man dressed in the rags
   of a homeless man carrying a sign reading “if only I was a migrant”,

08/02/2016 – BERLIN, Germany – Controversial asylum package may be impotent

   The German government’s much-debated Asylum Package II, a raft of
   measures to give Berlin more control over the migrant crisis may fail
   to deliver because it has been poorly worded. One of the main measures
   set out is a temporary halt on the right to family reunion, in which
   asylum-seeker unaccompanied children can apply to have the German
   government fly their families over because of the human right to family
   life.

   The enormous number of unaccompanied youths — which includes anyone
   under age of 18 — has led to an even greater number as relatives to the
   youths are shipped to Germany, prompting the change to get migrant
   numbers down for 2016. Yet the fact the majority of unaccompanied
   minors don’t register as asylum seekers and instead are given tolerated
   foreigner status means only 105 minors properly registered in 2015
   would actually be affected by the change, [76]reports Die Welt.

08/02/2016 – BAVARIA, Germany – Police investigating ‘refugee themed’
carnival float

   [77]Asylum Defence Pictures of a a wood and cardboard mock-up of a
   Second World War vintage Tiger tank adorned with signs reading ‘Asylum
   defence’ and ‘Asylum Package III’ taken by police have been passed onto
   the office of the prosecutor after the float was featured in carnival
   parades this [78]weekend.

   Officers at the scene didn’t prevent the parade from going ahead
   because although they suspected the satirical float was possibly guilty
   of acting seditiously, they decided to respect the right of artistic
   freedom. One of the signs on the tank was a reference to the
   controversial ‘Asylum Package II’, a new package of government measures
   designed to give Germany greater control over their borders, but
   significantly delayed from its planned January implementation date.

   El-Hussein who pumped thirty rounds in a Danish freedom of speech
   convention, and a Synagogue in February last year was carrying a gold
   illuminated Qur’an at the time of his death. Police examination of his
   corpse after he was shot and killed by police officers found the
   bookmark to be placed at a passage dealing with the treatment of
   disbelievers and worshippers of idols, a fact that has been kept secret
   by police until now, [80]reports Berlingske.

   Danish lawmakers have expressed surprise that the police had chosen to
   withhold this information for so long.

07/02/2016 – DONAUESCHINGEN, Germany – Police called to migrant centre brawl

   Several patrol cars and attendant officers were called to a migrant
   centre after an Iraqi elder brother objected to his 15 year old sister
   being in “contact” with a 22 year old Syrian male at the same facility.
   Using typically euphemistic language the [81]police report on the
   situation stated the officers arrived to find between 50 and 60
   migrants engaged in “tumultuous debate” over the matter.

   Through “courageous action” the officers calmed the “threatening”
   situation and took five into police custody.

   messages painted in red and black paint over the posters read “stop
   asylum” and is thought to have taken place on Friday night

07/02/2016 – COLOGNE, Germany – Woman jumped by gang

   The daughter of a prominent Cologne musician was jumped by a gang who
   beat her in the face and tore off her clothes. Although there was a
   number of other people in close proximity to the attack, none responded
   to the 26 year old woman’s cries for help. Worse, when she managed to
   escape to a nearby bar for aid she was thrown out by the landlord who
   said he didn’t want any trouble at the establishment.

   sling across the man’s chest, had to be resuscitated on the spot before
   being admitted to intensive care in hospital.

   The attackers apparently demanded  money and the victim’s phone. One of
   the attackers reportedly understood no German at all, and it is
   believed that one of the pair carried a knife. The man is said to have
   no life threatening injuries, but does have stab wounds.
