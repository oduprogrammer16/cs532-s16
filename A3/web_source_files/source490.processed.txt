Valentine Corset #Giveaway!

   Posted On [62]03 Feb 2016

   Tag: [65]Giveaway, [66]Relationships, [67]Sweeps, [68]Valentine's Day

   So my love for [69]corsets is no secret now. They‚Äôre pretty sexy, can
   be classy, dressy, casual, cute‚Ä¶ and are the absolute perfect piece to
   wear to wow someone special on Valentine‚Äôs Day. Here are a few of my
   favorite looks for Valentine‚Äôs Day enchantment.

Absolute Cherry Pop Red-White Corset

   [70]ABSOLUTE CHERRY POP RED-WHITE CORSET

   This corset somehow makes me think of a sexy carhop. Great for
   Valentine‚Äôs Day in red, there is also a [71]cotton candy pink option
   that adds a little bit of cuteness to this style.

 Dragon Lace Cupcake Pink Corset

   [72]DRAGON LACE CUPCAKE PINK CORSET

   A little bit romantic pink, a little bit sultry black lace. Perfect not
   just for Valentine‚Äôs Day, but any time of the year, really.

 Laced Cloud Black Corset

   [73]LACED CLOUD BLACK CORSET

   Still one of my absolute favorite corsets Violet Vixen carries. This
   one screams romance to me. Beautiful, sexy, classy. Want a guy‚Äôs
   opinion? It‚Äôs my husband‚Äôs favorite, too.

 Lady of Roses Pink-Red Corset

   [74]LADY OF ROSES PINK-RED CORSET

   There‚Äôs no denying the romantic appeal of the Lady of Roses corset.
   Sweet and innocent‚Ä¶ with a naughty side underneath üòâ

 Love Triangle Number 9

   [75]LOVE TRIANGLE NUMBER 9

   Nothing innocent about this one‚Ä¶ This corset is ALL sex appeal and
   delicious naughtiness. Beautiful!

 Marilyn‚Äôs Starlight Seduction

   [76]MARILYN'S STARLIGHT SEDUCTION

   Victorian style romance at it‚Äôs finest. Sweet, stunning, beautiful, and
   a little bit different with its straps.

 Pinup Doll Red Corset

   [77]PINUP DOLL RED CORSET

   The perfect red color corset for Valentine‚Äôs Day, sweet and romantic
   with its lace and bow. The Pinup Doll corset is also available in
   [78]pink, [79]hot pink, and a few other, less Valentine-ish colors.

       My idea of a romantic evening nowadays is just being able to sit

       I haven‚Äôt got the first clue about being romantic. That‚Äôs just not
       me. I know what should be considered romantic. I guess for me if
       for 24 hrs or a weekend my husband cleaned the house and I didn‚Äôt
       have to lift a finger or leave the bed, that would be romantic.
