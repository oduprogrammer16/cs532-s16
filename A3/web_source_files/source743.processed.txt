   WILL AMERICA live up to its commitments under the recent climate
   negotiations in Paris? It’s an open question – and an early test will
   come in Virginia.

   By spring, Gov. Terry McAuliffe will make a decision with huge
   implications for Hampton Roads and the nation. McAuliffe can side with
   the state’s biggest polluter – Dominion Resources – and decide to
   increase total carbon pollution from power plants. Or McAuliffe can
   side with President Barack Obama and the spirit of the Paris climate
   talks to reduce pollution at the state level under the “Clean Power
   Plan.”

   Obama told 196 nations last December not to worry about America’s
   gridlocked Congress. States, he said, will hasten the switch to
   carbon-free energy. But now it’s time to deliver. Virginia – a border
   state, a swing state – could set the national tone.

   Here’s the bad news: McAuliffe’s two-year record on energy has been
   surprisingly dismal. He has talked a good game on climate change. He
   made it a big campaign issue when running against former Attorney
   General – and climate denier – Ken Cuccinelli in 2013.

   But when pressured by big-money fossil fuel interests, McAuliffe has
   been consistent, siding with polluters almost every time. He supports
   offshore drilling, even as the City Council in Virginia Beach retreats.
   He’s been cheerleader-in-chief in supporting fracked-gas pipelines and
   new power plants. (The associated methane leakage makes those plants
   nearly as bad as coal.)

   McAuliffe even lobbied the White House and the U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency to lower Virginia’s targets for reducing carbon
   pollution under the Clean Power Plan. McAuliffe said the original
   number was too ambitious. Dominion and the coal companies were saying
   the same thing.

   In August, the EPA announced that Virginia’s target had been lowered.
   Up to 1,500 more pollution-related asthma cases could now happen in
   Virginia by 2030 and dozens more heart attacks.

   McAuliffe can redeem himself with a decision on how to implement the
   CPP. Dominion has found a feature in the CPP that would actually allow
   Virginia to increase greenhouse gas emissions from power plants by 2030
   while still “conforming” to this federal rule designed to lower such
   gases. Dominion is lobbying McAuliffe’s staff to embrace the company’s
   approach.

   Dominion is not the surprise here. It has a national reputation as a
   corporate steamroller, always pushing for more fossil fuel combustion
   (and wildly expensive nuclear power) while ignoring or minimizing
   climate science. The company built a massive new coal-fired power plant
   in Virginia in 2012 despite warnings from scientists, many
   shareholders, and some Wall Street analysts that coal was a big risk.
   Hmmmm.

   Now Dominion CEO Thomas Farrell is pushing for fracked gas use while
   skipping over the science. In a speech last month sponsored by the
   Virginia Chamber of Commerce, he acknowledged that clean energy had
   made strides. “But the truth is, we are still in the age of fossil
   fuels,” he stressed, asserting that about 70 percent of U.S. energy now
   and for the next several decades will come from fossil fuels. Not
   exactly “the spirit of Paris.”

   What’s surprising here is that McAuliffe, his poor energy record
   notwithstanding, would actually consider a state global warming plan
   that makes global warming worse. If a high-profile Democratic governor
   can do this, then what real hope is there that America will truly stand
   up in time to make the dramatic carbon cuts agreed to by 196 countries
   in Paris?

   Obama should give McAuliffe some advice: Do the right thing. Virginia’s
   plan should cover old and new power plants and use a so-called
   mass-based approach to reducing pollution, not the work-around
   “rate-based” approach Dominion prefers.

   McAuliffe gets the final say here. He alone, under the federal rule,
   gets to craft Virginia’s pollution plan. Congress has no say, nor does
   Virginia’s Republican-controlled General Assembly. And Dominion,
   despite its lobbying money, doesn’t get to decide. Just McAuliffe.

   Sources say the governor will make up his mind by late spring. In all
   fairness to Virginia voters and to supporters of the Paris agreement
   worldwide, he should immediately announce his support of a Virginia
   pollution plan that reduces total carbon emissions, thus meeting the
   planet’s needs, if not Dominion’s.
