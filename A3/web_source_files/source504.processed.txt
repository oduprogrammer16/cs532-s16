ERIC ANTHONY LOPEZ – Interview

   [16]music
   21 years old [17]Eric Anthony Lopez made his Off-Broadway Debut in THE
   JACKIE MASON MUSICAL IN NYC. In two weeks he will make his WEST
   END/Opera Debut in Carmen at the Wimbledon Theatre in London. We have
   conducted an interview with him.
   [18][1.jpg]
   What is your most memorable experience when you made your Off-Broadway
   debut in "The Jackie Mason Musical" in NYC at just 19?
   Wow! What a day. My first show was a blur. Everything happened so fast.
   I was cast in the show 2 months into my first semester at
   Manhattanville College, so I ended up having to balance both the first
   2 months. The most memorable experience I would say was before the show
   walking into my dressing room for the first time & showing my family
   around backstage. I was a swing & eventually took over the part full
   time after leaving school. I was just so happy to be there, to have my
   first job, and one that would last for over a year! I was so grateful
   knowing that I was really doing my first long run every night. The cast
   and crew were beyond supportive, welcoming, and have become some of my
   closest friends. As a newbie to the business, newbie to living on my
   own in NYC, it was a grand & bold step to make but the supportive
   company made the transition from college student to professional actor
   seamless.
   How does it contrast in doing "The Phantom of the Opera" in the UK?
   Well for one, I'm in a new country for 6 months that I have never been
   to before. I'm over 21 now, not as green and use to a long run of a
   show now, so 6 months seems like a piece a cake compared to over a year
   in a production. My confidence and voice has grown since meeting my new
   teacher Mary Setrakian & taking classes & training on various things
   weekly while I was doing "Mason" in NYC. I also feel way more confident
   in my skin & my career. In terms of the show, "Phantom" has a long
   legacy because it's been running the West End & Broadway for 30 years.
   I just try to remember that I'm there to tell a story that everybody
   knows & serve a character. As long as I do that, I'm doing my job. I
   also love traveling and being abroad. I'm obsessed.
   What leads you to these early successes in particular your opera debut
   in WEST END's CARMEN at The Wimbledon Theatre in London?
   I would say luck & my nonstop persistence to get seen by the panel
   definitely played a role in getting "Mason" when I did. When I say
   luck, I mean a position opening up when I did and being so close to
   NYC, I don't believe it's like hitting the lottery. There was an
   opportunity, I believed the role, I auditioned & happen to get it. They
   took a chance on a blank resume. What kept me there and cascaded other
   amazing opportunities like CARMEN was playing on my strengths, doing
   the work & finding the joy in doing. Just because I left college & took
   a great opportunity in NYC didn't mean I stopped training. I trained a
   lot more over the course of that year than in college or high school
   combined. Also, I made people take me seriously with showing up on
   time, rarely calling out of the show, being nice, professional &
   respectful - simple things like saying please, thank you, I think go a
   long way. Just adulting - as they call it (laughs). I often feel like
   the life I live right now & the maturity that I have and expected to
   have doesn't match my actual age. I feel life I'm in my late 20's. This
   will be my first opera ever - I'm not a trained opera singer, however
   my voice naturally lends itself to that genre. I'm beyond grateful to
   be involved.
   Tell us about Broadway Inspirational Voices & what it means to you.
   Broadway Inspirational Voices is a choir of 70 professional performers
   from New York City's Broadway & Off-Broadway shows, past and present
   founded in 1994 & directed by the fearless (Tony Nominee) Michael
   McElroy. I had to privilege joined when I was 20. Being in that group,
   surrounded by top notch Broadway performers, & ones I've been fans of &
   have been my heroes for years growing up - it's just a blessing. For
   me, because of when I joined, It has been the best education from the
   best in the business. I truly learned something new every time in that
   rehearsal room. Everyone in the group has been beyond welcoming,
   helpful made me feel like I belonged. I don't belong in that room, & I
   know of many performers who are still waiting for a spot to open up, so
   the fact that I joined when I did has been - a blessing. I don't know
   how else to describe it. The music is a little out of my comfort zone,
   but I love a challenge and live to push myself. I truly feel if a
   Broadway show (which is my goal) is in my path, I will be more prepared
   to take that on because of what I learned from Michael McElroy & the
   other members of the choir. Period. There is no choice but to meet them
   where there at & rise to the occasion. My first gig with them was
   singing at The Papal Mass Event at Madison Square Garden. What a way to
   join a company. I am so lucky & grateful to be apart of The BIV family.
   Ever since joining BIV, I feel like I truly belong somewhere.
   If you can have it your way, name three highly regarded performers in
   musical theatre whom you would like to collaborate with in the near
   future?
   Woman
   1. Sierra Boggess
   2. Audra McDonald
   3. Montego Glover (who is currently the soprano section leader and 10
   year veteran of BIV)
   Men:
   1. Norm Lewis (who was an earlier member of BIV & remains a good friend
   to the choir)
   2. John Owen Jones
   3. Ramin Karimloo
