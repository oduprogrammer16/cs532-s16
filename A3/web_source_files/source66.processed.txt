Obamas Go on “Kingly” Vacation, Shocked to Learn It’s About to Cost Them BIG

   [18]Share on Facebook38k[19] Tweet[20] Email[21] Print

   Last week, a Freedom of Information Act request by a conservative
   watchdog group regarding the Obamas’ vacation expenses for 2014 was
   finally fulfilled by the Department of Homeland Security, thus allowing
   Americans a glimpse into the president’s “kingly” lifestyle.

   “(T)he August 2014 [22]Martha’s Vineyard and Christmas 2014
   [23]Honolulu vacations for President Barack Obama and his family cost
   taxpayers $1,243,057.80 for Secret Service accommodations alone,”
   [24]Judicial Watch announced in a press briefing Wednesday.

   Coupled with how much the Obamas spent on other posh luxuries —
   $39,575.95 at Paradise Luxury Rentals; $34,827.57 at The Kahala;
   $209,218.25 at Cabana Girl LLC; $4,073,464.30 in flight expenses; etc.
   — they in total spent $5,316,522.10 for just two vacations.

   While vacationing in Martha’s Vineyard, the Obamas reportedly stayed in
   a grandiose seven-bedroom, 8,100-square-foot mansion in the Chilmark
   neighborhood.

   Obamas' vacation

   According to [28]Fox News, their Secret Service agents likely stayed in
   a similarly sized mansion elsewhere, as they did in 2011, when they
   reportedly partied like rock stars in a slightly smaller six-bedroom
   Victorian home located in the Oak Bluffs neighborhood.

   “I expect parties during the summer — people come here to have fun;
   they’re on vacation — but I didn’t think it’d be Secret Service people
   here protecting the president,” one local resident remarked at the
   time.

   The Kahala

   The average American spends about 1/1000 of that amount on their
   vacations, which they pay for out of their own pockets. Yet to the
   Obamas, it somehow made sense for them to spend gargantuan sums of
   taxpayer funds to vacation like kings and queens.

   Did they do it out of ignorance, or did they do not it because they
   care nothing about the American taxpayer? The second reason seems more
   likely, especially since Judicial Watch [29]had to sue the Secret
   Service last November to get this FOIA request fulfilled.

   Apparently, the Obamas wanted to hide their lavish lifestyle from the
   public. Sadly for them, they just got busted — and it’s going to cost
   them big time.
