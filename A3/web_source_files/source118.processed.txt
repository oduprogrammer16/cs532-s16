   8 February 2016 - day/night match (50-over match)
     New Zealand innings (50 overs maximum) R M B 4s 6s SR
   View dismissal [34]MJ Guptill c Hastings b Zampa
   [35][icon-vid-pop-up.png] 59 84 61 4 3 96.72
   19.5 Zampa has troubled Guptill today and now he's got him! He drifted
   the legbreak to pitch outside leg stump and Guptill was always in
   trouble trying to sweep that without clearing his front foot, he had to
   reach for that and was in an awkward position - cramped for room - to
   play it, he ended up top edging tamely to short fine leg, where
   Hastings took an easy catch 131/3
   View dismissal [36]BB McCullum* c Hastings b Marsh
   [37][icon-vid-pop-up.png] 47 39 27 6 3 174.07
   9.3 McCullum's final innings is over! And he gets a massive cheer from
   the Seddon Park crowd, they are rising to their feet to clap off their
   captain. That went high in the air and Hastings caught it superbly.
   McCullum had charged and slogged but ended up slicing the ball high in
   the air over the bowler's head. It was surely Maxwell's catch? He only
   had to move a little to his right from mid-off. But Hastings had moved
   quickly to the ball from mid-on and at the last moment he took a look
   at Maxwell, who was not going for the catch, so Hastings stuck out his
   large hands and the ball dropped in 84/1
   View dismissal [38]KS Williamson b Boland [39][icon-vid-pop-up.png] 18
   38 28 1 0 64.28
   18.2 bowled him! Williamson has been tied down by the line Australia
   have been bowling to him, they have been outside off stump on a good
   length most of the time, cutting off his leg side. Now Williamson gets
   a slightly wide one but the length is good outside off, he reaches to
   cut the ball without moving his feet - he usually moves back and across
   so smoothly - and bottom edges on to his stumps. That ball actually
   seamed into the right-hander to hit the bottom edge 123/2
   View dismissal [40]HM Nicholls c Smith b Hazlewood
   [41][icon-vid-pop-up.png] 18 36 29 1 0 62.06
   28.4 make that four! Nicholls steps forward and plays a loose drive
   away from his body at a good length ball outside off, Smith is waiting
   at first slip. A really loose shot and another soft dismissal. New
   Zealand in danger of being derailed again after a strong start 171/4
   View dismissal [42]GD Elliott c Maxwell b Marsh
   [43][icon-vid-pop-up.png] 50 100 62 1 1 80.64
   43.2 two in two for Marsh, what a series he is having! Maxwell runs in
   from the deep square leg boundary and dives to take the catch. The ball
   was dipping sharply as he caught it. Elliott had got down on one knee
   outside off to play a slog-sweep of sorts, he timed it well but hit it
   in the air and not high or far enough 237/7
   View dismissal [44]CJ Anderson c Khawaja b Hazlewood
   [45][icon-vid-pop-up.png] 27 53 45 0 1 60.00
   40.3 Anderson has picked out Khawaja at long on! He stepped out to
   clear the straight boundary and was cramped for room a little by the
   line angling into him from around the wicket. He timed the shot well
   because it travelled really quickly to Khawaja, but he did not hit it
   high enough. Khawaja moved to his left to catch it 223/5
   View dismissal [46]L Ronchiâ€  c Boland b Marsh [47][icon-vid-pop-up.png]
   5 13 8 0 0 62.50
   43.1 Ronchi's struggles continue, he's mis-timed this one straight to
   long-on, where Boland takes an easy catch. The length was good and the
   line angling into middle stump, Ronchi swung across the line and
   mis-timed it completely 237/6
   View dismissal [48]DAJ Bracewell b Hastings [49][icon-vid-pop-up.png] 2
   13 5 0 0 40.00
   45.2 bowled him! Bracewell is bowled between bat and pad as he moves
   forward to drive at a good length slower ball that swings into him a
   fair bit. Hastings hits middle and leg stump. Australia have got the
   ball hooping in the last few overs. New Zealand in danger of being
   bowled out with so many overs to go 246/9
   View dismissal [50]AF Milne lbw b Boland [51][icon-vid-pop-up.png] 5 7
   4 1 0 125.00
   44.3 an appeal for lbw and he has been given this time! Milne has a
   word with Bracewell and is walking off. That was missing leg stump
   surely? The full ball swung sharply into the right-hander and hit the
   boot before ricocheting on to the bat. He should have reviewed that, it
   was sliding past leg stump. 246/8
   [52]MJ Henry not out 0 5 3 0 0 0.00
   View dismissal [53]IS Sodhi b Hastings [54][icon-vid-pop-up.png] 0 1 1
   0 0 0.00
   45.3 and it's all over! Hastings ends the innings with 27 balls to go!
   He bowls a swinging yorker at the No. 11 Sodhi, who jams his bat down
   on it. He manages to get some bat on it but not enough to prevent the
   ball from squeaking through and rolling on to his stumps 246/10
   Extras (lb 6, w 9) 15

   is waiting at first slip. A really loose shot and another soft
   dismissal. New Zealand in danger of being derailed again after a strong

   45.2 to Bracewell, bowled him! Bracewell is bowled between bat and pad
   as he moves forward to drive at a good length slower ball that swings
   into him a fair bit. Hastings hits middle and leg stump. Australia have
   got the ball hooping in the last few overs. New Zealand in danger of
   being bowled out with so many overs to go 246/9
   45.3 to Sodhi, and it's all over! Hastings ends the innings with 27

   [63][icon-vid-pop-up.png] 44 46 36 4 2 122.22
   11.2 caught behind! Khawaja stays on his crease with feet rather
   stationary and drives loosely away from his body at a length ball that
   seams away from him, a thick edge and Ronchi dives to his left to take
   the catch, rather like how Nicholls got out 75/2
   View dismissal [64]DA Warner c Elliott b Henry
   [65][icon-vid-pop-up.png] 16 19 14 3 0 114.28
   4.6 he's been caught at cover! the ball was nothing special, short of a
   length and angling into him, Warner was on the back foot to punch over
   cover but the ball stopped on him a bit and he ended up spooning it
   straight to Elliott 39/1
   View dismissal [66]SPD Smith* lbw b Sodhi [67][icon-vid-pop-up.png] 21
   56 35 1 0 60.00
   18.4 lbw! Smith does not like the decision and he is going to have a
   word with Bailey. They are reviewing this one. Smith was a long way on
   the front foot, down on one knee as he tried to sweep that ball. There
   was no edge and that ball is going straight on to hit the stumps 94/3
   View dismissal [68]GJ Bailey b Henry [69][icon-vid-pop-up.png] 33 74 60
   3 0 55.00
   29.5 bowled him! Marsh has been hitting it like a dream but Bailey
   pokes tentatively at a short of a length ball that nips into him from
   outside off and gets an inside edge on to his stumps. Is there life in
   this New Zealand defence? 50 wickets for Henry at an average of 22.
   He's got there in his 23rd game, behind only Ajantha Mendis 153/5
   View dismissal [70]GJ Maxwell c McCullum b Sodhi
   [71][icon-vid-pop-up.png] 0 2 2 0 0 0.00
   18.6 Sodhi has broken open this game! Maxwell pushes with hard hands
   away from his body at a legbreak pitched on a good length outside off,
   thick outside edge caught by McCullum at first slip 94/4
   View dismissal [72]MR Marsh c & b Henry [73][icon-vid-pop-up.png] 41 58
   42 4 1 97.61
   33.4 Henry thinks that ball has come straight off the boot and back to
   him, he half appeals for a catch. And that should be enough for an
   appeal and now the umpires are talking to each other. Henry bowled one
   right in the blockhole and Marsh jammed his bat down on it. I think
   that was hit into the ground and the boot. But Henry thought it was
   right off the boot and after ages the umpires decide to go to the third
   umpire. And would you believe it, that has gone right off the inside
   edge right on to the toe of the boot and back to Henry, who got down
   low in his follow through to take the catch, Marsh is out and Seddon
   Park explodes in a huge cheer. What a stroke of luck for New Zealand.

   View dismissal [74]MS Wadeâ€  c Guptill b Milne [75][icon-vid-pop-up.png]
   17 49 26 1 0 65.38
   39.6 short ball, pulled straight at Guptill on the edge of the circle
   at midwicket! Actually that was not straight at him, he had to take a
   few quick steps to his left and dive to catch it. Wade hit that firmly
   but placed it i the vicinity of one of the most agile catchers in the
   game 184/8
   View dismissal [76]JW Hastings c Elliott b Anderson
   [77][icon-vid-pop-up.png] 6 23 19 0 0 31.57
   38.1 the Hairy Javelin has caught it at deep square leg, running in
   from the boundary! Anderson peppered Hastings with another bouncer, it
   got big on him as he tried to hook, dragging the ball against the angle
   across him from over the wicket, the top edge was never going to clear
   the boundary and Elliott ran it and judged it well enough. New Zealand
   edge ahead in the chase! 179/7
   View dismissal [78]A Zampa c McCullum b Anderson
   [79][icon-vid-pop-up.png] 2 12 11 0 0 18.18
   40.5 edged and this time McCullum dives forward at first slip to catch
   it close to the ground! Zampa pushes from his crease away from his body
   at a good length ball that seams across him, the last time it fell
   short to McCullum's left, this time he dives forward to catch it before
   the ball can hit the grass! 184/9

   [82][icon-vid-pop-up.png] 2 11 12 0 0 16.66
   43.4 from Milne, that's the game! A direct hit from point has run out
   Boland and the Kiwis rush towards Nicholls the fielder at point! Boland
   backed away towards leg to steer the ball towards point and ran,
   Nicholls moved quickly to his right, fielded cleanly and nailed the
   stumps with a swift throw, Boland was a couple of feet short 191/10
