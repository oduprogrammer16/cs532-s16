100 people still trapped in Taiwan quake rubble

   in [79]International, [80]News February 8, 2016 219 Views
   Rescue efforts are still ongoing to pull out possible survivors with
   over a 100 people still thought to be trapped under the rubble of the
   collapsed building which crumbled after a 6.4 magnitude earthquake hit
   the southern Taiwan city of Tainan.
   Two people were rescued on Sunday with time fast running out for those
   still missing and are suspected to be buried deep under the rubble of
   the collapsed 17 storey building.

   [82]A woman who was shielded under the body of her husband was rescued
   48 hours after the quake struck.

   “The rescued woman, Tsao Wei-ling, was found lying under her dead
   husband. Their two-year-old son, who was also killed, was found lying
   nearby.” Local legislator Wang Ting-yu told reporters on Monday.

   A second survivor – Li Tsung-tian – had been pulled out of the rubble
   rescuers also confirmed on Monday.

   Reporting from outside the collapsed building, Al Jazeera’s Rob
   McBride, revealed that rescue efforts had reached critical point.

   “It has been three days, and it’s understood that those stuck under the
   rubble and still alive won’t be able to last longer without food and
   water.
   “Lots of questions are being asked about how this building was
   constructed. There are a lot of stories floating around about the
   builder. You could almost say he is the most wanted man in Taiwan right
   now. Everyone is trying to find him,” he said.
