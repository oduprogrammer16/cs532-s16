   Amid the speculations already swirling around Apple’s [57]iPhone
   announcement next month, here's another rumor to tack onto the growing
   list.

   A new report suggests the 4-inch iPhone, a likely successor to the
   iPhone 5S dubbed the “[58]iPhone 5SE,” could come in hot pink.

   But take this colorful rumor with a grain of salt.

   According to Japanese tech blog [59]Mac Otakara (and first spotted by
   [60]Apple Insider), a third-party accessory maker in Japan said the new
   iPhone will be available in three colors when it's released: silver,
   space gray and hot pink. There was no mention of the gold or rose gold
   of past iPhone models, contrary to previous rumors.

   However, [62]9to5Mac, known for successfully reporting Apple product
   leaks ahead of launches, is sticking to its original reporting that the
   iPhone 5SE will come in the same colors as the iPhone 6S — rose gold,
   gold, silver and space gray.

   The hot pink color choice would certainly be a departure from Apple's
   direction toward more muted colors in past iPhone rollouts, but it
   wouldn't be the first time the company has embraced hot pink. It was
   featured as one of the sixth-generation iPod colors.

   The iPhone 5SE — "the E" is believed to stand for "special edition" —
   is reportedly smaller in size at 4 inches, while the iPhone 6 and 6S
   were both 4.7 inches; the Plus models come in at 5.5 inches.

   Apple iPods

   The rumored hot pink 5SE could look like the pink iPod from the latest
   generation of Apple music players.

   [63]9to5Mac also reports the iPhone 5SE will go on sale in April this
   year and cost $450, the same price as the iPhone 5S.

   The 5SE is expected to have the curved glass display, A8 chip and 8
   megapixel camera like the iPhone 6, which is a slight downgrade from
   the A9 chip and 12 megapixel camera in the 6S. It will likely come with
   a barometric sensor, support Apple Pay with NFC, and be able to shoot
   Live Photos — but won't support 3D Touch.

   Apple is also rumored to announce details around a new [64]iPad Air 3
   at an event next month.
