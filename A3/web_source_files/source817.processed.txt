DHS ordered agent to scrub records of 100s of Muslims with terror ties

   What could possibly have been Obama’s motive to do this? What possible
   effect could it have had other than to allow for more jihad terror
   attacks?

   [18]Philip Haney

   “DHS ordered me to scrub records of Muslims with terror ties,” by
   Philip Haney, [19]The Hill, February 5, 2016 (thanks to [20]Pamela
   Geller):

     Amid the chaos of the 2009 holiday travel season, jihadists planned
     to slaughter 290 innocent travelers on a Christmas Day flight from
     the Netherlands to Detroit, Michigan. Twenty-three-year old Nigerian
     Muslim Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab intended to detonate Northwest
     Airlines Flight 253, but the explosives in his underwear
     malfunctioned and brave passengers subdued him until he could be
     arrested. The graphic and traumatic defeat they planned for the
     United States failed, that time.

     Following the attempted attack, President Obama threw the
     intelligence community under the bus for its failure to “connect the
     dots.” He said, “this was not a failure to collect intelligence, it
     was a failure to integrate and understand the intelligence that we
     already had.”

     Most Americans were unaware of the enormous damage to morale at the
     Department of Homeland Security, where I worked, his condemnation
     caused. His words infuriated many of us because we knew his
     administration had been engaged in a bureaucratic effort to destroy
     the raw material—the actual intelligence we had collected for years,
     and erase those dots. The dots constitute the intelligence needed to
     keep Americans safe, and the Obama administration was ordering they
     be wiped away.

     After leaving my 15 year career at DHS, I can no longer be silent
     about the dangerous state of America’s counter-terror strategy, our
     leaders’ willingness to compromise the security of citizens for the
     ideological rigidity of political correctness—and, consequently, our
     vulnerability to devastating, mass-casualty attack.

     Just before that Christmas Day attack, in early November 2009, I was
     ordered by my superiors at the Department of Homeland Security to
     delete or modify several hundred records of individuals tied to
     designated Islamist terror groups like Hamas from the important
     federal database, the Treasury Enforcement Communications System
     (TECS). These types of records are the basis for any ability to
     “connect dots.” Every day, DHS Customs and Border Protection
     officers watch entering and exiting many individuals associated with
     known terrorist affiliations, then look for patterns. Enforcing a
     political scrubbing of records of Muslims greatly affected our
     ability to do that. Even worse, going forward, my colleagues and I
     were prohibited from entering pertinent information into the
     database.

     A few weeks later, in my office at the Port of Atlanta, the
     television hummed with the inevitable Congressional hearings that
     follow any terrorist attack. While members of Congress grilled Obama
     administration officials, demanding why their subordinates were
     still failing to understand the intelligence they had gathered, I
     was being forced to delete and scrub the records. And I was well
     aware that, as a result, it was going to be vastly more difficult to
     “connect the dots” in the future—especially beforean [sic] attack
     occurs.

     As the number of successful and attempted Islamic terrorist attacks
     on America increased, the type of information that the Obama
     administration ordered removed from travel and national security
     databases was the kind of information that, if properly assessed,
     could have prevented subsequent domestic Islamist attacks like the
     ones committed by Faisal Shahzad (May 2010), Detroit “honor killing”
     perpetrator Rahim A. Alfetlawi (2011); Amine El Khalifi, who plotted
     to blow up the U.S. Capitol (2012); Dzhokhar or Tamerlan Tsarnaev
     who conducted the Boston Marathon bombing (2013); Oklahoma beheading
     suspect Alton Nolen (2014); or Muhammed Yusuf Abdulazeez, who opened
     fire on two military installations in Chattanooga, Tennessee
     (2015)….

                 Obama is a Muslim who has no loyatly to the USA. Obama
                 has also released tens of thousands of illegal alien
                 criminals on to our streets. A shame that he was never

                      Aren’t most all the Eutropostan leaders in the same
                      bed together with obummer
                      To really do some serious cleaning up of isis and
                      other terrorist groups there would need to a western
                      coalition so strong that nothing could penetrate
                      it….but with the mindset of today’s leaders I just
                      can’t see a real ” clean up and clean out” coalition
                      out there.
                      So then what to do??? Just sit back and wait…which
                      is about what we are doing now…the air strikes is
                      like dropping firecrackers from 25,000 ft trying to
                      hit some any hills even though they are mostly
                      accurate the ants are just scattered and there are
                      always more any hills.
                      Now to the guy who scrubbed the records…were
                      hearings going on around thes time why didn’t he
                      testify? Why didn’t he just report this to NSA or
                      FBI or even Fox news or anybody?????..I know he
                      probably needed his job..but in my case if I knew I
                      was ordered to do something wrong….especially
                      wrongness that affected the security of the
                      government I would have been singing like a canary.

       They ordered him to do it and so he did it. This man is a traitor,
       guilty of treason, and liable to hanging, in my opinion. Too many
       people today just go along with evil instead of resisting it. Might
       it cost you your job? Sure it might. But is your job worth more
       than your soul? Your honor? This man has blood on his hands if any
       of those whose names he erased harm innocent Americans. What a
       sorry excuse for a man. Dishonorable wretch. Like all those noble
       police officers in Rotherham, England who never spoke up to defend
       the raped girls because they feared being called ‘racist’. Like all
       those FBI agents swearing they will “revolt” if Hillary is not
       charged by the Obama Justice Department. But when she is not
       charged (and she won’t be) they will all be as quiet as church
       mice, enslaved to their paycheck and cowering. I say if you do not
       resist the evil, you are the evil.

            Those are all very brave words by an anonymous contributor.
            Unlike the average armchair warrior, Philip Haney actually
            came out under his real name and exposed the actions of the
            DHS in consciously and purposely undermining security in the
            US.
            By now it is clear that the Obama administration takes every
            available action to undermine the security and identity of the
            United States. There’s no debate necessary on whether Obama is
            a Muslim or not: the actions are consistent and predictable.
            Obama’s internal state of mind is not a factor in the
            equation.

                 Armchair warrior? Friend, you don’t know me. And you’d do
                 well not to know me. This scumbag you’re defending so
                 bravely came out AFTER he retired. That takes a lot of
                 balls, huh? But you’d probably do the same thing: follow

                 retirement, then start singing. The damage is done by
                 then, dumbass. It’s logic like that that has got us where
                 we are. He should have resisted from the first moment
                 they told him to do it. It’s called honor. That’s what I
                 would have done. In fact, that’s what I have done. So

                      you bravely disobeyed your commanding officers and
                      did exactly what you thought was right, at the risk
                      of your own life and career. You don’t have to

                      Nobody can take on the establishment alone. He
                      probably came out when he saw that people had his
                      back. It’s probably just strategic and smart that he
                      waited. He would have been shut up anyway…ah, unless
                      people were stirring the pot already. That is why it
                      is important to keep the flow of communication

                      Rich is correct. This information could have been
                      useful against Obama in the reelection of 2012. Now,
                      it is only useful for people who like to say, “I
                      told you so!”
                      He should have gathered concrete evidence of the
                      orders to scrub and the prohibitions to add new
                      information.
                      It’s too little, too late. The damage has been done.
                      RonaldB says, “Why not give is some of your heroic
                      stories?” That presents a ridiculous standard. By
                      that standard, nobody can criticize him unless they
                      have undergone a similar ordeal. So, he is virtually
                      immune from criticism.
                      I have stood up to superiors in my previous job. My
                      boss told me to move to dismiss a speeding citation
                      that could easily have been proven. I suspected
                      ulterior motives, and I refused. He had to go do it
                      himself. I made notes of what happened, and moved
                      onto the next case.
                      It was not as dramatic as the life & death scenario
                      of Homeland Security monitoring of terrorists, but
                      it serves.
                      Even if you yourself have fortunately never had to
                      work for such a person, I would never begrudge your
                      criticism of the man who participated in a cover up.

            Look, of course it is better to come out too late than not at
            all. My point is simply that he should have resisted the order

                 certain that DHS requires an oath that includes following
                 orders from the president. and leadership is where the

                 Elections have consequences. I am more concerned about
                 the integrity of the election process, since electronic

       Who is pulling the strings? Are there foreign intelligence agents
       involved in protecting Islamic terror? Are there domestic Muslim
       traitors in the Obama administration?
       All files should be copied and then handed over to the next

       Obama is making Americans vulnerable. One has to assume that Obama

            I did a search on Philip Haney on Google. He came out in
            December with the information that he had been ordered to
            scrub the vital information on terrorists in the US. Other
            than the article in “The Hill”, Breitbart, and one or two
            others, there’s nothing. There’s no investigation, no
            hearings, and no follow-through by congressional watchdogs.
            So, my conclusion is that by disobeying orders and and getting
            himself fired and losing his pension (and possibly prosecuted
            for releasing classified information), there would be no
            effect at all.
            And, now that he has come out publicly, under his own name, he
            is being called a “scumbag” by people who supposedly are on
            his side.

       Obama’s intent and whether the scrubbing was traitorous or not
       depends on how distant the “ties” to terror were. Am I not
       remembering correctly, or haven’t we heard recently that there are
       hundreds of thousands of people on no-fly lists who don’t belong on
       those lists? Isn’t it true that there are only six degrees of
       separation between any two strangers on earth? By some accounts
       there are actually only four or five degrees of separation between
       any two strangers. In other words, everyone on earth knows someone
       who knows someone who knows someone who personally knew, say, Bin
       Laden, or Awlaki, or the caliph Bhagdadi, or whoever. So the answer
       to my question may be obvious to some of you, and if so, please
       enlighten the rest of us: how close were the terror “ties” that
       were scrubbed? What criteria are used to enter someone into such a
       database? Anybody know? Sometimes the criteria seem to be sensible,

            Your question is sensible.
            On rereading the article, my impression is that this is not an
            active “no-fly” list, but a list used for further
            investigation and alerts. I guess it would be quite possible
            that an individual with terror connections in the databases
            would be flagged at some point…and possible the noted
            connection was false.
            However, this is not the case of making records more accurate.
            This is a case of removing any record linking “Muslim” with
            “terrorist”. It is part of the de facto compliance by the Bush
            and Obama administrations with resolution 16/18 of the United
            Nations, making any implication that Islam is connected with
            terrorism illegal. That can’t be done in the US, due to the
            Second Amendment, so the fallback position is the “shaming”
            described by Secretary of State Clinton in 2011.
            As revereridesagain noted, much of the basis for this action
            can be found described in Stephen Coughlin’s “Catastrophic
            Failure”.

            interests? This is not only in the Obama administration. The

            And perhaps this may be only the first in a string of Haney

            I certainly would not want to have been in Mr. Haney’s

            Faced with the order to delete records, what do I do? Refuse,

            only to be stonewalled by an utterly Obama-compliant media, be
            fired, possibly face prosecution?
            Or, having been shocked to my core by being given such an
            insane order, perhaps I come to my senses and realize that I
            am governed by traitors and fools, and decide to bide my time,
            keep my powder dry, amass as much information as I can in the
            time I have remaining before my retirement, and decide to
            dedicate my retirement to doing all I can to get the word out.
            I might still be prosecuted, even in my retirement. (Who knows
            what non-disclosure agreements, and penalties for breach

            And then there’s this : Phil Haney is not the only employee at

       Non-disclosure agreements should have a clause allowing for these

       the subversive aiding and abetting, an enemy who has successfully
       penetrated our government….and has placed the nation in grave
       danger. Like a state of emergency….I am a outsider, interested
       reader, but from my readings he has in place ” his subversives in
       every important position to continue… and really it is very
       incredible that no emergency meeting is held, but with who, who is
       not involved in this cohesive group. This is just an idea…by the
       time the awareness occurs it seems almost too late to waddle thru
       the thick necessary laws to protect the nation, by revealing the
       “planned subversion.” I think there is plenty of evidence….maybe a
       suspension of power until facts are uncovered. Just a thought.

            Well maybe when congress recognizes that the people will not

            responsible.
            In our system of government, THIS SHOULDN’T BE HAPPENING.
            The constitution is the elephant in the room that nobody wants
            to talk about because

            DO, on a bible or a Koran, or a copy of Shades of Gray (who

            Congress knows that to impeach Obama means that they are ALL
            FIRED FOR ACQUIESING TO A DICTATOR.
            And that is why they won’t act. But if you tell them you HOLD
            THEM RESPONSIBLE and they cannot sit around like little girls
            and complain about Obama, THEN maybe they’ll do their job.

            reconstitute the government until is represents the people
            again.
            The first step is to tell them that you hold them
            responsible–it’s their warning.

                 But this idea that we’ll take no action because we’re
                 going to have a new president is despicable.
                 Either there is a problem or there is not. If there is a
                 problem, you don’t defer to a stinkin’ election
                 cycle…ELECTION CYCLES ARE PROBLEMS IN AND OF THEMSELVES.
                 The American people have to stop living by election
                 cycles and do what is right in every cycle.
                 It’s called principles.

                 to Oppressaphobe – who sez, “…The constitution is the
                 elephant in the room that nobody wants to talk about…”
                 No, dear Oppressaphobe. I’m sorry, but the elephant has
                 left the building.
                 Cheers!

       This article screams TREASON!
       What more do you need to know?
       Your president ORDERED the destruction of pertinent information
       that experts say would have possibly prevented the Boston Marathon
       and other attacks.
       Hello Congress!! Are you out there?? I know there’s only about 700
       of you but could you kinda look into this?
       Hello American public!! Are you out there?? Do you have a phone or
       a pen? Can you shake yourselves from your stupor or do we all have
       to suffer a massive attack before you act.
       Tell your elected officials enough is enough.

       Whistleblowers like this will only come forward in an environment
       where people are already agitating for change.
       Keyboard warriors provide cover for people like this-even though it
       feels like nothing is being accomplished. Men like this cannot come
       out of hiding without a public outcry. When the people are
       screaming out, then this man won’t take the blame because the
       government sees that it’s the people who are agitating for change.
       They don’t dare to take this man on because they know that the
       people are mad and bubbling up in anger over the injustice.
       When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when
       the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.
       This, from proverbs, needs to be every americans prayer, regardless
       of religion.

       Certainly explaining Obama’s behavior has been a tortuous
       undertaking for 7+ years now.
       At some point, you have to ask yourself why?
       What you are logically left with is not very good for America. So,
       logically, Americans are not waiting for the answers but jumping to
       the conclusions needed to save the country.
       If Obama wanted to counter this trend, he would be acting in a very
       different way.

       “…Most Americans were unaware of the enormous damage to morale at
       the Department of Homeland Security, where I worked, his
       condemnation caused. His words infuriated many of us because we
       knew his administration had been engaged in a bureaucratic effort
       to destroy the raw material—the actual intelligence we had
       collected for years, and erase those dots. The dots constitute the
       intelligence needed to keep Americans safe, and the Obama
       administration was ordering they be wiped away…”
       The approach of a second or third rate leader; don’t take
       responsibility for past errors, make sure your voiceless
       subordinates take the rap. But for a man, like Obama, who
       principally believes in himself, a shotgun press release blaming
       his workers would have been morally effortless, and more instances
       of this type of behaviour are sure to surface in the years to come.

     Just before that Christmas Day attack, in early November 2009, I was
     ordered by my superiors at the Department of Homeland Security to
     delete or modify several hundred records of individuals tied to
     designated Islamist terror groups like Hamas from the important
     federal database, the Treasury Enforcement Communications System
     (TECS). These types of records are the basis for any ability to
     “connect dots.” Every day, DHS Customs and Border Protection
     officers watch entering and exiting many individuals associated with
     known terrorist affiliations, then look for patterns. Enforcing a
     political scrubbing of records of Muslims greatly affected our
     ability to do that. Even worse, going forward, my colleagues and I
     were prohibited from entering pertinent information into the
     database.
       That’s just the sample of what you’ll get if you vote Hillary.

       So we should be surprised? Obozo has been on a bender to “remodel”
       America to make it more to his liking… I will support and vote for
       any Republican who convinces me that he will undo every devious,
       sneaky, evil, America-hating thing the guy has done in his nearly 8
       years as our “manchurian candidate”. Obozo has convinced me that
       anything he does is evil and retrograde, designed to damage the
       USA.
