The murder of my friend Giulio Regeni in Egypt was an attack on academic
freedom

   [40]Neil Pyper

   Students or anyone else conducting research in dangerous places should
   be better protected by their university – and their government

   The body of Giulio Regeni was [48]discovered in a ditch in Cairo on 2
   February, showing evidence of torture and of a slow, horrific death.
   Giulio was studying for a PhD at the University of Cambridge, and was
   [49]carrying out research on the formation of independent trade unions
   in post-Mubarak Egypt. There is little doubt that his work would have
   been extremely important in his field, and he had a career ahead of him
   as an important scholar of the region.

   Giulio, originally from Fiumicello in north-east Italy, had a strong
   international background and outlook. As a teenager, he won a
   scholarship that allowed him to spend two formative years studying at
   the [50]United World College in New Mexico. He was especially
   passionate about Egypt. Before beginning his doctoral research, he
   spent time in Cairo working for the United Nations Industrial
   Development Organisation ([51]Unido). At the age of 28, he stood out
   with his big hopes and dreams, and he was committed to pursuing a
   career that would allow him to make an impact on the world, which is a
   poorer place for his passing.

   Those of us who worked and spent time with him are grieving – but above
   all, we are furious about the manner of his death. Giulio’s case also
   has much broader implications for higher education in the UK and
   beyond.

   British universities have long fostered an outward-looking,
   international perspective. This has been evident in the consistent
   strength of [52]area studies since the middle of the 20th century. The
   fact that academics from British universities have produced
   cutting-edge research on so many areas of the world is an important
   factor in the impact and esteem that the higher education system there
   enjoys.

   signs of torture'

   In order to carry out this research, generations of scholars have
   conducted fieldwork in other countries, often with authoritarian
   political systems or social unrest making them dangerous places to
   study. I carried out such research in Peru in the 1990s, working there
   while the country was ruled by the authoritarian government of
   [54]Alberto Fujimori.

   Alongside this research tradition, universities are becoming
   [55]increasingly international in their outlook and makeup. Large
   numbers of international students attend the classes, and their
   presence is crucial for making campuses more vibrant and diverse.

   Giulio’s murder is a clear and direct challenge to this culture, and it
   demands a response. If our scholars – especially our social scientists
   – are to continue producing research with an international perspective,
   they will need to carry out international fieldwork. By its nature,
   this will sometimes involve work on challenging issues in volatile,
   unstable countries.

   Universities clearly have a duty of care to their students and staff.
   This is generally exercised through ethics committees, whose work means
   that much greater care is taken than in the past to ensure that risks
   are managed appropriately. However, there is the danger that
   overzealous risk management could affect researchers’ ability to carry
   out their work, making some important and high-impact research simply
   impossible.

   We cannot protect against all risks, but no scholar should face the
   risk of extrajudicial violence. If universities are to remain
   internationally focused and outward-looking, we must exercise our duty
   of care towards our students and colleagues when they are working in
   other countries.

   But there are limits to what academic institutions can do on their own.
   It is vital that governments raise cases such as Giulio’s, and push
   strongly for full investigations and for those responsible to be held
   to account.

   The Italian and Egyptian authorities have announced [56]a joint
   investigation into what happened to Giulio, but the British government
   also has a responsibility to make representations to this effect. That
   would send the message that any abuse by authorities of students and
   researchers from British universities will not be tolerated. A petition
   will be circulated to this effect, and Giulio’s friends and colleagues
   will be campaigning on the issue in the days and weeks ahead.

   Giulio Regeni’s murder is a direct challenge to the academic freedom
   that is a pillar of our higher education system. He is only [57]one of
   many scholars who have been arbitrarily detained, and often abused, in
   Egypt. As a scholarly community and as a society, we have a duty to
   strike to protect them and their colleagues who study in dangerous
   places the world over.
