   ATLANTA -- A man charged with the murder of a 75-year-old woman could
   be on the verge of freedom due to a mistake made by the judge presiding
   over the case.

   On Monday, the Supreme Court of Georgia announced Geary
   Otis could not be prosecuted for the murder 2013 murder of Mary Oliver
   due to double jeopardy.

   Otis' public defender, Amanda Grantham, went to tell him the news just
   hours after the unanimous ruling was released.

   "I think at first he was kind of stunned, and didn't know what to say
   because it was kind of sudden," said Bryan Grantham, Amanda's husband
   and Otis' co-counsel.

   Otis was 64 years old when police say he raced up a set of stairs at
   the Baptist Towers where he and Oliver lived. He allegedly fought
   with Emmanuel Surry, who was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital, before
   kicking in the door to Oliver's room and stabbing her several times.
   Evidence showed Oliver was stabbed with such force that it cut into her
   bone and spinal column.

   Police found Otis covered in blood and carrying two large kitchen
   knives. He had to be subdued by Tasers.

   At his trial, Otis' attorney Amanda Grantham asked the court to
   consider "what crazy people look like," as "mental illness" comes in
   many forms. "I'll be asking for the only verdict that speaks the truth
   in this case, and that Geary is not guilty by reason of insanity."

   Prosecutors immediately called foul, arguing that was the first time
   they were told the defense would be using insanity as an argument. They
   asked for a continuance, a few days to research Otis' mental health.

   If Judge Ural Glanville had agreed, the trial would have continued as
   allowed by law.  But instead, Glanville declared a mistrial.  The
   Supreme Court said that was mistake, because any new trial now would
   amount to double jeopardy, trying Otis twice for the same crime.

   Bryan Grantham understands some people might be frustrated by the
   Supreme Court's decision but argues, "If you're going to celebrate
   America, you have to celebrate that when errors are made in the legal
   system, part of the justice is that we don't tolerate that."

   Oliver's family did not respond to our calls.

   "The probably don't like us very much right now and I can understand
   that.  But at the end of the day we're not just defending Geary Otis,
   we're defending a system," said Grantham when asked what he would say
   to Oliver's family, who will now never get a chance to hold the man
   they believe killed her accountable.

   Glanville also said he could not comment at this time. If the decision
   holds, he will have to sign the paper officially setting Otis free.

   Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said in a statement that
   his office is filing an appeal. The statement read:

     In the matter of Geary Otis v. The State, Fulton County District
     Attorney Paul L. Howard Jr. states that this case involves the
     brutal home invasion and stabbing death of 76-year-old retiree, Mary
     Oliver.  Mrs. Oliver, who had just returned from a birthday
     celebration with her daughter, was stabbed multiple times throughout
     her head and body.  Additionally, the defendant assaulted a male
     retiree and an Atlanta Police Officer at the same complex with the
     knife used to murder Mrs. Oliver.

     To hold that the State cannot try the Defendant because a Fulton
     County Judge declared a mistrial under the circumstances of this
     case is shocking to the consciousness of justice and fair play.
     Particularly, when we consider the court’s concurrent opinion
     written by Supreme Justice David Nahmias.

     Justice Nahmias said, “It is apparent that the trial court in this
     case was striving to reach a fair trial.”

     Such an outcome is beyond belief.  We are filing an immediate
     request for reconsideration.

   Oliver's family [41]filed a lawsuit against Baptist Towers Apartments
   shortly after the murder. Her daughters accused the facility's security
   of being noticeably lax over a two year span -- [42]allowing some
   residents to buy drugs and hire prostitutes.

   Otis, who was facing life in prison without parole, currently remains
   at the Fulton County Jail.  Grantham says it will likely be several
   weeks before he is released.
