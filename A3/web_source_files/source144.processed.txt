The Challenge

   There are nearly 1.1 million REALTORS® in the country. Yet only a small
   fraction approach their business development the way true “business
   people” design and grow the structure of their businesses. Only 24% of
   all REALTORS® earn over $100K a year and less than 5% earn over $250K a
   year. Many REALTORS® experience self-imposed ceilings in their
   production … and far too many face early “burn out.” All this happens
   due to a lack of a business strategy, lack of business systems.

   This is the direct result of an industry that provides significant
   “systems training” and “sales training” – but practically zero
   “business” training and coaching. The simple reality is that your real
   estate operation should be treated the same as any legitimate business.

   We have the fix.

The Solution

   At our very core, Elevate Transition Programs helps real estate agents
   “Transition” from being just a successful real estate agent today… into
   a business owner tomorrow with a clear future. A business owner who has
   a plan which focuses on:
     * High margin clients
     * Implementing administrative assistance when your career demands it
     * Leveraging success by adding a protégé who eventually becomes a
       “partner” in the business, understanding teams & cooperatives
     * Developing a path to successfully “sell” your business when that
       time eventually comes

   We call it “starting with the end in mind”. At Elevate
   Transition Programs, we help REALTORS® be strategic, be smart, be
   prepared for the future. We help you run your business like a “real”
   business.

The Exclusive Elevate Programs

   At Elevate we pride ourselves in setting the “real estate” aside from
   the “business.” We then fully explore the best ways to structure your
   business for enhanced profitability, quality of life, efficiency and
   the best leveraging of your unique skills. Ultimately, we enable you to
   have a plan in place that affords you the opportunity to “sell” or
   transition your business when that time is appropriate.

   It all begins with our Elevate OneDay Event. Register Now!
