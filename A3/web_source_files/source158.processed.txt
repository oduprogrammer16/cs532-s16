   While the title may raise a few eyebrows given the equity market’s
   rocky start to 2016, its inspiration is Glenn Frey, the legendary
   singer-songwriter for the Eagles, who passed away on January 18, 2016.
   “Take it Easy,” co-written by Frey, was the Eagles’ first single and
   one of their biggest hits. As an Eagles fan, I headlined this post with
   the song’s title both to pay tribute to the great Glenn Frey and to
   capture my thoughts about recent market turbulence and the danger of
   extrapolating too much information from a month of performance.

   Can a month forecast the year’s performance?

   To be clear, the markets face a number of challenges: questions about
   Federal Reserve policy in the year ahead, continued stress in the
   energy sector, the global implications of a slowdown in China. These
   and other issues have rattled markets lately and will in all likelihood
   command our close attention as 2016 progresses.

   But [111]It would be a mistake to conclude that a rough January tells
   us much about how the year will unfold. Even as we’ve enjoyed strong
   equity returns in recent years, we’ve often experienced surprisingly
   weak Januaries. The chart below shows U.S. stock market returns for
   both January and the rest of the year in each of the last 15 years.
   Clearly, in recent history, January returns alone have not been a great
   predictor of the year to come.

   easy1_012016

   It’s not just January that has proved a poor predictor. The next chart
   displays the relationship between the returns in any one month and the
   return for the rest of the year from 1928 through 2015. The plot shows
   that there’s almost no relationship between the one-month and
   rest-of-year returns. The diffuse scatterplot cautions us against using
   a month of performance such as this year’s rough January alone to draw
   conclusions about how the year will evolve.

   The findings from the two charts should not come as a surprise given
   the nature of equity returns, which do not accrue in a linear or
   incremental fashion. And even if the equity market’s performance in a
   single month can’t tell us much about the rest of the year, it reminds
   us both to expect higher volatility in equity returns relative to an
   asset class such as fixed income and to expect that the volatility of
   volatility—the changes in volatility from one period to the next—will
   be higher as well.


   easy2_012016

   Mitigating “big number shock”
   As equity markets gyrated through the first few weeks of January, media
   coverage raised the risk of ‘big number shock.” Daily swings of
   hundreds of points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average seem to create a
   sense of crisis.

   But it’s important to remember that the big numbers are a function of
   the significant growth in equity markets and equity indexes over the
   decades. Although a 100- , 200-, or 300-point swing in the Dow can make
   for an attention-grabbing headline, such triple-digit moves are neither
   rare nor out of character historically.

   To guard against big-number shock, look at price movements in
   percentages rather than points. As of January 26, for example, a
   162-point swing in the Dow amounted to a price change of 1%. Two
   decades ago, a 1% price swing was a move of just 53 points, a less
   eye-catching number. (As of January 26, a 1% move in the S&P 500 was 19
   points; 20 years ago it was 6.)

   It’s also useful to remember that we’ve been living through a period of
   unusually low volatility, which may have left us unaccustomed to normal
   equity market turbulence. Prior to August 2015, it had been nearly four
   years since the U.S. equity market declined 3% or more in a day. Since
   the 1950s, however, we’ve seen declines of greater than 3%, on average,
   roughly every eight months. The chart below shows the distribution of
   daily returns as a percentage of trading days in each decade. Rather
   than viewing these occasionally sharp movements (whether positive or
   negative) as abnormal, it would be reasonable to consider them part of
   the expected patterns of equity market performance.

   easy3_012016

   “Don’t let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy”

   The message here is not to discount some of the thorny questions
   investors will grapple with in the year ahead; rather, it’s to remind
   us of the importance of having informed expectations about market
   volatility. As coverage of every market movement and event crescendos,
   it’s every bit as important to know what to tune out as what to tune
   in.

   To paraphrase Glenn Frey, we should take it easy in areas where we have
   little or no control—changes in investor sentiment, the market’s
   volatile swings from day to day, the latest forecasts from
   prognosticators. We can take it easy and refuse to react to these
   developments based on emotion.

   We can spend our time and efforts more productively on investment
   decisions that we can control: our asset allocation, our level of
   diversification, our investment costs, our saving and spending
   patterns. We can invest with an advisor who can provide guidance and
   coaching in periods of market stress.

   As we’re running down the road in 2016, we can choose to put emotion
   aside, broaden our perspective, and “take it easy.”


   Notes:

   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

   All investments, including a portfolio’s current and future holdings,
   are subject to risk.

   The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any
   particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.

   Fran, thanks for the reminder to look forward and that past performance
   does not predict future results. Yet, for those able and willing to
   take risks, and don’t need to sell in the near future, buying now when
   the the fund are at lower price may be a risky but reasonably
   attractive strategy.

   Excellent article. Really appreciate the frequent updates and
   encouragement to stay the course. Having been a Vanguard investor for
   several years now, I have learned that volatility is a normal part of
   inventing. When the storm hit, as they have this past January…..as the
   title says…..”Take it Easy”.

   Fran, thank you for this very important post. The data presented has
   convinced me and should convince other investors to “tune out” the
   media chatter regarding near term future predictions of stock market
   returns. The main message for me was that short term volatility is a
   persistent characteristic of stock market investing as is the annual
   bias for positive returns and to focus on those factors within your
   control. Great advise, thank you!
