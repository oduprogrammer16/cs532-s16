   Brooklyn Center

   My name is APEX. My Animal ID # is A1063692.
   I am a male brown and white am pit bull ter mix. The shelter thinks I
   am about 1 YEAR 1 MONTH old.

   I came in the shelter as a STRAY on 01/26/2016 from NY 11208, owner
   surrender reason stated was STRAY.

   MOST RECENT MEDICAL INFORMATION AND WEIGHT
   02/11/2016 Exam Type VACCINATE – Medical Rating is 3 C – MAJOR
   CONDITIONS , Behavior Rating is NONE, Weight 49.0 LBS.

   No Final Exam

   01/26/2016 PET PROFILE MEMO
   01/26/16 19:43 Upon intake Apex was loose body, chewing on leash and
   jumpy. He scanned negative for a microchip and allowed all handling.

   02/01/2016 WEB MEMO
   A volunteer writes: Apex (meaning the top or highest peak of something)
   is very appropriately named. Being a young puppy and not knowing that
   much about snow, he seemed pretty excited about it in an adorable way.
   So excited about it, in fact, that he wanted to play king of the castle
   on every single snow mound that we passed. Even though our walk took a
   bit longer than usual, I didn’t mind since he was having so much fun.
   All he wants is an owner to take him out for a long romp in the snow.
   Come meet him today!

   01/28/2016 BEHAVIOR EVALUATION – AVERAGE
   Exam Type BEHAVIOR
   Apex came in as a stray, so his past behaviors in a home are unknown.
   At intake it was reported Apex had loose body posture jumping and
   chewing on the leash, he allowed all handling. During SAFER Apex came
   into the assessment room loose and wiggly, allowed all handling items
   to be conducted without issue. Apex joins the game, mouths the leash in
   a playful manner with soft body posture during the tag interaction, and
   during the resources portion of the assessment Apex was easy to handle
   when engaged with the item. Apex appears to be sociable, and did not
   display any behaviors concerns, so the department feels he can be
   suitable for an “Average” adopter. Look: 1. Dog’s eyes are averted. His
   ears are back, his tail is down, and he has a relaxed body posture. Dog
   allows head to be held loosely in Assessor’s cupped hands. Sensitivity:
   1. Dog leans into the Assessor, eyes soft, soft and loose body, open
   mouth. Tag: 1. Dog assumes play position and joins the game. Or dog
   indicates play with huffing, soft ‘popping’ of the body, etc. Dog
   mouths the leash with soft body posture. Dog jumps on Assessor once
   play begins. Squeeze 1: 1. Dog gently pulls back his paw. Dog licks
   hand. Squeeze 2:1. Dog gently pulls back his paw. Toy 1: 1. Dog settles
   close, keeps a firm grip and is loose and wiggly. He does not place his
   body between you and the toy. Dog-dog: When off leash with other dogs,
   Apex greets with a tense body but offers a play bow. Once in the pen
   however he becomes obnoxiously sexually motivated and was slow to
   respond to human interruptions.

   01/28/2016 GROUP BEHAVIOR EVALUATION
   Exam Type GROUP BEHAVIOR
   When off leash with other dogs, Apex greets with a tense body but
   offers a play bow. Once in the pen however he becomes obnoxiously
   sexually motivated and was slow to respond to human interruptions. 2/01
   update: Apex continues to be very sexually driven and does not respond
   to human interruptions or dog corrections. Once the interaction was
   ended, he redirected his arousal and mounted the handler while being
   returned to his kennel and was slow to respond to human corrections.
