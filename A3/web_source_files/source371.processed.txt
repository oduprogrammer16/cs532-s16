[4]collective haul

   [5]colourpop kathleen lights colourpop where the night is weenie porter
   telepathy trust me bossy lumiere 2 lumiere lippie pencil
   [6]too faced natural matte palette nest paradise nars radiant creamy
   concealer lush the kiss lip scrub
   You know, I'm really bad with spending money. Like, really bad. I'm a
   sucker for new Colourpop releases, and I'm a sucker for a good perfume
   and concealer. I'm weak.
   A couple weeks ago, Colourpop came out with a limited edition lipstick,
   in a new formula called [7]Trust Me. I knew that if I didn't pick it
   up, I would forever regret it, unless they released it as a part of
   their permanent line. Let me tell you, the formula of this is AMAZING.
   I'm really mad that I didn't pick up another one, because it's a great
   formula. I also picked up [8]Bossy lip pencil to match.
   In that same order, I picked up some of Colourpop's collaborations with
   KathleenLights. I have her [9]orignal quad, and that charmed the pants
   off of me. However, when I saw her second quad, [10]Where the Night Is,
   I became very smitten. It doesn't have the most conventional colours,
   buuuuut it's a beauty. [11]Weenie and [12]Porter are easily my
   favourite shades in this quad, but [13]Telepathy is a show stealer.
   Kathleen also came out with [14]Lumiere 2, the liquid lipstick version
   of her ever popular Lumiere lipstick. I picked up the [15]matching
   pencil, and called it a day.
   On Valentine's Day, I couldn't make it without stopping at Sephora and
   Lush. As a Valentine's Day present, Cody picked me up the [16]Too Faced
   Natural Matte palette. I've been after this palette for a while, and
   it's just gorgeous. ALL THE WARM TONES.
   For myself, I picked up [17]Nest Paradise in a rollerball. I just had
   to take advantage of the triple fragrance points while I could. It
   smells amazing. Paradise is definitely more of a summer fragrance (top
   note is blood orange), but it'll perk me right up in the rainy weather
   that won't seem to cut me a break lately.
   My last two purchases were really impulses. I seem to be collecting
   concealers like it's no one's business lately, and I really wanted to
   try the [18]NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer. I picked up a trial size
   version, to make sure I really loved it before I sprung for the full
   size. I don't know if the shade I picked up is an exact match, but I
   will make do. At Lush, I was fully intending on getting more than just
   [19]The Kiss, but I showed decent restraint. That, and they were out of
   the small sizes of the masks I like.

[28]our anniversary

   [29][our%2Banniversary%2B2.jpg] [30][our%2Banniversary%2B3.jpg]
   [31][our%2Banniversary.jpg]
   I realize that this is a little weird to post RIGHT after a post I made
   about a bad relationship I was in, but this was a really good day in my
   life. Yesterday was Cody's and my third anniversary. Yes, we're that
   couple that got together on Valentine's Day. I asked him out with a
   heart made out of sticky notes on his windshield.
   For our first anniversary, we went all out and went up to Seattle. We
   went to the aquarium, the Great Wheel, Pike Place, all that jazz. It
   was a great day, but I was exhausted afterward. Last year, we just had
   a more chill anniversary, involving Sephora, a pizza and Ben & Jerry's.
   This year, we combined the two past years, slightly. We decided to have
   an early lunch, as the Valentine's dinner rush is a little insane here.
   We went to Red Robin (surprise, surprise...), and headed to Sephora and
   Lush afterward. Again, not really a surprise if you know us.
   Deadpool is one of our favourite Marvel characters, so we were
   naturally very excited to go see the movie yesterday. We normally wait
   a few weeks until the hype has died down, but we just couldn't wait. It
   was fantastic, and I couldn't recommend it enough.
   We then went to the store to pick up some flowers for my mom, and I
   bought us two mini pies to enjoy at home.
   After that, it was pretty much just Disney movies on Netflix.
   I couldn't have asked for a better anniversary. I didn't need
   fireworks, or anything they show in the movies. It was perfect, and I
   couldn't ask for a better boyfriend. I really appreciate Cody, and I
   love the guy to death.

[38]to my teenage self in an abusive relationship

   [39][dear%2Bteenage%2Bself%2B.jpg]
   Before we start with this post, I'm going to slap a huge content
   warning on this. This post details my time in an abusive relationship.
   Please read with caution. While my ex never hit me, he was very
   emotionally abusive, as well as manipulative. My story may be different
   than other abusive relationship stories, and everyone will experience a
   bad relationship differently. I wouldn't wish a bad relationship on
   anyone.
   Dear teenage self,
   You will get caught up in the attention of one of your best friend's
   exes. she will call you a slut for dating her "sloppy seconds". You'll
   stop being her friend after that, because you realized she will soon
   start valuing the opinion of the boys she dates more than yours.
   This boy will be no good for you. It seems nice until the time he asks
   you how far you've gone, and he takes you farther than you wanted to
   go. It seems nice when he gives you your first kiss, and asked you to
   be his girlfriend while you were stargazing. It seems nice when he
   takes you to his house after you got sick at school after state
   testing. it seems nice until you have to start babysitting him, and he
   disappears for days at a time.
   It seems nice until you have to make a story up for the school security
   guard, and tell him you were sick of babysitting this boy. You didn't
   tell him you two broke up because he got what he wanted.
   This boy will hurt you. He will not hit you, but he will leave
   emotional scars that have still not healed to this day. He will try to
   control you, and try to turn it around on you whenever something is his
   fault. He will make you do things you don't want to do, and he will
   make you hate your mom while you're dating him. He will leave marks on
   you to tell the world that you are his, that you'll mistake as love.
   It will hurt when he leaves you. but it will hurt even more when you
   realize that you never said yes, and no one will believe you because
   you two were dating. It will hurt even more when you realize one of
   your best friends knew he was hurting you, and you wouldn't let him do
   anything about it. It will hurt the most when you can't tell your mom
   about what happened.
   No one will believe you because everything looked fine on the outside.
   No one will believe you because they didn't pay attention to the
   warning signs. No one will believe you because YOU didn't pay attention
   to the warning signs. No one will believe you because it took you
   months to realize what happened.
   He will call you a liar. He will get upset, because you told him you
   wouldn't do what his ex did. Because he did the same thing to her that
   he did to you.
   Saying "I will die without you" is not okay. Disappearing for days at a
   time is not okay. Forcing you to do something you don't want is not
   okay. Turning things around to make them seem like your fault is not
   okay. Manipulating you, and isolating you from your friends is not
   okay.
   You will lose friends in this relationship. You will lose friends that
   you thought would be there for you through this whole situation.
   He will break up with you for the first time over a text message. He
   will break up with you the second time over a text message. You two
   will patch things up the first time after a couple of hours, and your
   best friend thinks that you shouldn't. You should have listened to
   them. Because he will continue to hurt you.
   It's not your fault, he was the one that took advantages of your
   weaknesses. It's not your fault, he was the one that played the mind
   games. It's not your fault, because he was the one that didn't think he
   was doing anything wrong.
   You showed and told him about your most vulnerable parts, and he took
   advantage of that. You told him things that you had never told
   anyone.You told him about the one time you self harmed, about the time
   your best friend committed suicide, and what really happened with your
   dad. He took advantage of that vulnerability and used it to his
   advantage.
   It will take a long time for you to feel safe again. It will take a
   long time for you to trust someone again. It will take a long time for
   you to heal. Take all the time you need, because it is a very long
   healing process. You will process this differently than other people
   will, and it will be hard to "just get over it". You need to take time
   to process this.
   He will show up at the school he no longer attends to scare you. He
   will try to make friends with your friends, and he will try to snake
   his way back into your life. He will come back into your life months
   after the breakup, because he wants to "be friends". He will still try
   to have sex with you, and you'll get sick all over him one of the last
   times you see him. He will still try to convince you you two are
   together, but he won't be there for you in the same way that he used to
   be. When you get shot in the face with a firework, he won't be there to
   hold your hand and get you ice. When you're sitting with mutual
   friends, you won't laugh the same, and he won't look at you the same.
   He made you fall in love with him, and never felt the same way. He
   won't pretend anymore.
   You will see him at a comic book convention, and hide yourself in the
   quiet room for hours with one of your best friends. You will see him at
   the gas station. to this day, you will still have anxiety attacks when
   you see him.
   He will find the boyfriend you have now on Facebook, and send him vile
   things and tell him what a liar you are. He'll tell him he never loved
   you, among other crass things.
   It will take a long time for you to fully process everything. It will
   take a very long time to escape him.
   It will take a long time to realise one of your closest friends in the
   world was in a horrible relationship at the same time. like you, she
   suppressed everything and didn't tell anyone.
   You will be okay.  you may not feel okay tomorrow, but you will be okay
   down the road. You will find someone that loves you for who you are,
   and what you've been through.
   It will take you a while to realize all relationships are different,
   healthy or not. Some people get out of their abusive relationships, and
   some don't. Some can't. Some can't make it out before it's too late.
   Controlling relationships are not romantic.
   It is still abuse if they try to manipulate you.
   It is still abuse if they try to fuck with your mind.
   It is still abuse if they spin everything to be your fault.
   It is still abuse if their family makes fun of you, in front of you.
   It is still abuse when they go out of their way to find you.
   You will feel upset for a long time. you will still have anxiety
   attacks when you see him five years later at the gas station.
   You still get choked up talking about it.
