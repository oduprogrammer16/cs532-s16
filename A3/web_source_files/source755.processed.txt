   Emirates Telecommunications Group Co is suing Nigeria competitor MTN
   Group Ltd. over plans by Africa’s biggest wireless company to buy local
   Internet provider Visafone Communications Ltd.

   The lawsuit centers on MTN’s potential use of Visafone’s 800 megahertz
   of spectrum, Abu Dhabi-based Etisalat’s Nigeria unit said in an
   e-mailed statement on Monday. “Not to challenge will entrench the
   dominance of MTN in the data services market,” the company said.

   MTN Nigeria has been served with court papers and the phone company was
   in court last week about the matter, spokesman Funso Aina said by text
   message. Tony Ojobo, a spokesman for the Nigerian Communications
   Commission, the regulator that approved the Visafone deal, said the NCC
   hasn’t received any official correspondence from Etisalat questioning
   the approval of the MTN acquisition.

   In 2013, the NCC said MTN, the biggest mobile-phone company in Nigeria,
   had become dominant in the mobile-voice market. The South African
   company is also in talks with the regulator to settle a $3.9 billion
   fine for missing a deadline to disconnect unregistered subscribers last
   year.

   MTN had 62.5 million Nigerian subscribers as of the end of September,
   according to the NCC’s website. Globacom and Airtel Nigeria had about
   31 million each, while Etisalat was the country’s fourth-biggest
   operator with 23 million customers.

   MTN shares declined 0.8 percent to 140 rand as of 12:04 p.m. in
   Johannesburg, valuing the company at 259 billion rand ($16 billion).
