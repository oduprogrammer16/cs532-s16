   CES is quickly become the place to show off [12]concept cars. Not to be
   left out of the fun, German automaker BMW shared its vision of an
   autonomous car that is the complete antithesis of the driverless pod
   cars that have been shown off by [13]Google. [14]Based on the i8, the
   BMW i Vision Future Interaction (that's a mouthful) gives the driver
   the option of driving the car themselves or kicking back letting the
   car take control while you check out the gigantic 21-inch panoramic
   display that's controlled via gestures, touch or voice. It's technology
   wrapped inside the vehicle you want to drive down the coast.

   The electric/autonomous concept car has three modes: Pure Driving when
   you want to actually drive. The Assistance feature actively intervenes
   when appropriate while Auto Mode is autonomous. When do you go full
   auto, the illuminated steering wheel retracts and the driver can start
   playing with that giant dashboard display via gestures, touch and voice
   control.

   The new interaction method, AirTouch uses gestures and a confirmation
   button that's in the steering wheel, the driver can go through their
   contacts, navigation and the media center. When they go back into Pure
   Driving mode, the information on the giant screen is minimized.

   In addition to the dashboard display that spans the center and
   passenger portion of car, it has a 3D instrument cluster and heads-up
   display (HUD). Holger Hampf, head of user experience at BMW said the
   concept car is "not about technology or features, it's about a new
   interior experience." Of course that interior experience is powered by
   new features and technology.

   So while like all concept cars, we'll never be able to actually take
   this car for a spin, the ideas it contains will eventually seep into
   the carmaker's line up of vehicles. Let's just hope that in addition to
   a new interior experience the open top i8 is one the things that comes
   to life.
