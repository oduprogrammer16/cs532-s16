   Via [28]Washington Examiner:

     The State Department admitted Tuesday that Iran will get about $100
     billion in frozen assets under the Iran nuclear agreement, just
     weeks after Secretary of State John Kerry ridiculed that number as
     “fictional.”


     As part of sanctions relief under the nuclear agreement, Iran will
     have access to assets that the U.S. froze. For weeks now, the press
     has been reporting that this would be about $100 billion.


     But in mid-January, Kerry dismissed that estimate, and said it was
     closer to $55 billion.


     “That is a fictional number. I don’t know where it comes from,”
     Kerry said on MSNBC of the $100 billion estimate.


     But in recent days, Iran has boasted that it will have access to
     about $100 billion, which prompted questions from reporters on
     Tuesday. Despite Kerry’s remarks, State spokesman John Kirby
     admitted Tuesday that the U.S. would be releasing about $100 billion
     to Iran.


     But at the same time, Kirby explained that State is viewing the
     amount as only $55 billion, because it believes Iran will need to
     spend the other $45 billion to pay off debts. In the logic of the
     State Department, that means Iran really isn’t getting that
     additional $45 billion.
