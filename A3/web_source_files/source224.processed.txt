   is provided to you by FitnessKeeper, Inc. ("us" or "we" or "our" or
   "FitnessKeeper"), in connection with our partners, service providers,
   sponsors, or other affiliates. So that we may safely and responsibly
   manage this site for all of our users, your use of this site is subject
   to certain terms and conditions. The terms and conditions set forth
   below ("Terms of Use"), as well as the privacy policy set forth at
   [10]www.runkeeper.com/privacypolicy, apply to your use of the services
   and functionality provided on or through the Runkeeper.com site and
   mobile application (the "Services").

   By accessing and using the Services, you acknowledge that you have
   read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Use and the
   Privacy Policy. If you do not accept these Terms of Use and the Privacy
   Policy, you are not authorized to use the Services. We may modify these
   Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy at any time and such modification
   will be effective upon posting to the Services.

   images, video, audio, data and other material (collectively referred to
   as the "Content"). The Content may be owned by us or may be provided
   through an arrangement we have with others, including other users of
   the Services, or our partners, sponsors, or affiliates. The Content is
   protected by copyright under both United States and foreign laws.
   Unauthorized use of the Content may violate copyright, trademark, and

   use the Content except as permitted under these Terms of Use. No other
   use is permitted without prior written consent from us or the owner of
   the Content. You must retain all copyright and other proprietary
   notices contained in the original Content on any copy you make of the

   derivative version of, distribute, or otherwise use the Content in any
   way for any public or commercial purpose, except to utilize features of
   the Services that, by their nature, involve publishing or sharing of
   Content with the public. If you violate any part of these Terms of Use,
   your permission to access and/or use the Content and Services
   automatically terminates and you must immediately destroy any copies
   you have made of the Content.

   Various company, product, and service names displayed on the Services
   may be trademarks or service marks owned by others (the "Third-Party
   Trademarks"). Your use of the Services should be construed as granting,
   by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, any license or right to use any
   Third-Party Trademark displayed on this Services. The Third-Party
   Trademarks may not be used to disparage any applicable third-party, any
   of their products or services, or in any manner in which, in our
   reasonable judgment, may damage any goodwill in the Third-Party
   Trademarks.

   The Services include access to links to, and content and data from,
   third-party websites ("External Services"). These links, content, and
   data are provided solely as a convenience to you and not as an
   endorsement by us of the content on such External Services. The content
   of such External Services is developed and provided by others. In
   addition, the Services permit access to content posted, stored, or
   displayed at the direction of users of the Services, for which we
   cannot accept any responsibility or liability.

   The Services are for personal use only and may not be used in
   connection with any commercial endeavors except those that are
   specifically approved by us. The following activities are expressly
   prohibited: (i) collecting usernames and/or email addresses of other
   users by electronic or other means for the purpose of sending
   unsolicited email or other communications, (ii) any use of the
   Services, which in our sole judgment, degrades the reliability, speed,
   or operation of the Services or any underlying hardware or software
   thereof, (iii) use of web scraping, web harvesting, or web data
   extraction methods from Runkeeper even if the Runkeeper account owner
   gives permission; and (iv) any use of the Services which is unlawful or
   in violation of these Terms of Use.

   By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are 13 years
   of age or older. Your account may be terminated without warning, if we
   believe that you are under 13 years of age.

   Your use of the Services is subject, in our sole discretion, to
   termination at any time.

User Content

   The Services may now or in the future include functionality to permit
   the submission of Content at the direction of users of the Services
   ("User Content") and the hosting, sharing, and/or publishing of such
   User Content. You understand that whether or not such User Content is
   published, we do not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any
   submissions.

   You shall be solely responsible for User Content you submit and the
   consequences of our posting or publishing such User Content. In
   connection with any User Content you submit, you affirm, represent,
   and/or warrant that: (i) you own or have the necessary licenses,
   rights, consents, and permissions to use and authorize us to use all
   patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights
   in and to any and all User Content to enable inclusion and use of the
   User Content in the manner contemplated by the Services and these Terms
   of Use; and (ii) you have the express consent, release, and/or
   permission of each and every identifiable individual person in the User
   Content to use the name or likeness of each and every such identifiable
   individual person to enable inclusion and use of the User Content in
   the manner contemplated by the Services and these Terms of Use. By
   submitting the User Content to us, you hereby grant us a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable
   license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of,
   modify, display, and perform all or any portion of the User Content in
   connection with our provision of the Services and our (and our
   successors') business, including without limitation for promoting and
   redistributing part or all of the Services (and derivative works
   thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You also
   hereby grant each user of the Services a non-exclusive license to
   access your User Content through the Services, if you have permitted
   such access through your account settings, and to use, reproduce,
   distribute, prepare derivative works of, display and perform such User
   Content as permitted through the functionality of the Services and
   under these Terms of Use. We may maintain copies of any User Content
   for purposes of backup, security, or maintenance, or as required by
   law.

   In connection with User Content, you further agree that you will not:
   (i) submit material that is copyrighted, protected by trade secret or
   otherwise subject to third party proprietary rights, including privacy
   and publicity rights, unless you are the owner of such rights or have
   permission from their rightful owner to post the material and to grant
   us all of the license rights granted herein; (ii) publish falsehoods or
   misrepresentations that could damage us or any third party; (iii)
   submit material that is unlawful, obscene, defamatory, libelous,
   threatening, pornographic, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically
   offensive, or encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal
   offense, give rise to civil liability, violate any law, or is otherwise
   inappropriate; (iv) post advertisements or solicitations of business;
   or (v) impersonate another person. We do not endorse any User Content
   or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and we
   expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with any User
   Content. We do not permit copyright infringing activities and
   infringement of intellectual property rights in connection with the
   Services, and we will remove all Content and User Content if properly
   notified that such Content or User Content infringes on another's
   intellectual property rights. We may remove any Content and User
   Content without prior notice. We may also terminate your access to the
   Services, if you are determined to be a repeat infringer. A repeat
   infringer is anyone who has been notified of infringing activity more
   than once and/or has had any User Content removed from the Services
   more than twice. We also reserve the right to decide whether Content or
   User Content is appropriate and complies with these Terms of Use for
   violations other than copyright infringement and violations of
   intellectual property law, such as, but not limited to, pornography,
   obscene or defamatory material, or excessive length. We may remove such
   User Content and/or terminate your access for uploading such material
   in violation of these Terms of Use at any time, without prior notice
   and at its sole discretion.

   If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any
   User Content or other Content infringes upon your copyrights, you may
   submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
   ("DMCA") by providing our Copyright Agent with the following
   information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail):

   (i) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on
   behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;

   (ii) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been
   infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site
   are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such
   works at that site;

   (iii) Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing
   or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed
   or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably
   sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material;

   (iv) Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you,
   such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic
   mail address;

   (v) A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the
   material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright
   owner, its agent, or the law; and

   (vi) A statement that the information in the notification is accurate,
   and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf
   of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

   Our designated Copyright Agent to receive notifications of claimed
   infringement and other notices relating to User Content and/or
   violation of these Terms of Use (e.g., violations of criminal laws) is:
   Jason Jacobs, c/o FitnessKeeper, Inc. / Email: info@runkeeper.com. For
   clarity, only DMCA notices and notices relating to complaints in
   connection with User Content or violations of these Terms of Use should
   go to the Copyright Agent; any other feedback, comments, requests for
   technical support, and other communications should be addressed to our
   standard support contacts as identified on the Services.

   misuse of the Content or the Services. We shall provide notice to you
   of any such claim, suit, or proceeding and shall assist you, at your
   expense, in defending any such claim, suit or proceeding. We reserve
   the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter
   which is subject to indemnification under this section. In such case,
   you agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting our
   defense of such matter.
