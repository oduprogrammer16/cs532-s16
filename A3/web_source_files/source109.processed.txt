   Marshawn Lynch has [48]reportedly told close friends he plans to
   retire. He may have just told the rest of the world too.

   Lynch has never been fond of talking to the media. A huge press
   conference that allows him to announce the news and reflect on his
   career was never going to be his style. A pair of cleats on a power
   line is about the most Marshawn way of announcing his retirement. Even
   right down to the timing. Lynch doesn't need a spotlight. There are 120
   million people watching the Super Bowl and amid it all, he just posts a
   photo, an emoji and that's it.

   While the message might look cryptic enough to have some questioning
   whether it actually means Lynch is retiring, Richard Sherman removed
   any doubt.

     Salute to my guy [51]@MoneyLynch ... It was an honor sharing the
     field with you.
     ‚Äî Richard Sherman (@RSherman_25) [52]February 8, 2016

   The Seahawks also seemed to confirm the news.

   Lynch earned the nickname "Beastmode" for his running style. He gained
   9,112 yards during his nine-year career and probably broke just as many
   tackles in the process. Whether it was the most exciting four-yard run
   you'll see or his more famous runs, Lynch was always a spectacle when
   he touched the ball. His most famous play became known as the
   "BeastQuake" [56]but it was only one of a host of memorable plays.

   Lynch started his career in Buffalo after being selected by the Bills
   in the first round. After four seasons, he was traded to Seattle, where
   his career soared to another level. Lynch was the foundation of
   Seattle's success. He ran for at least 1,200 yards in four-straight
   seasons, becoming arguably the best running back in the NFL in the
   process.

   There was speculation Lynch might retire following last season. He
   eventually came back and played one last season before deciding to walk
   away.
