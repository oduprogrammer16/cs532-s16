[70]It's OK for Cam Newton to be a kid, but sometimes you have to be a
grown-up

   February 8, 2016 10:13am EST February 8, 2016 1:32am EST Cam Newton's
   childlike joy is infectious, but pouting like a child isn't nearly as
   appealing.

   Published on Feb. 8, 2016

   SANTA CLARA, Calif. — Cam Newton had a lot of fun and gained a lot more
   fans as he played his way to NFL MVP and led the Panthers to Super Bowl
   50.

   And just like that, as quickly as going into his dab, it was gone on
   Sunday night.

   The Panthers' quarterback didn't have much to celebrate in a 24-10 loss
   dominated by Denver's defense. Carolina's No. 1 offense was shut down,
   and Newton had his ugliest game of the season. He was only 18-of-41
   passing for 265 yards, and committed three turnovers under the pressure
   of a seven-sack attack fueled by game MVP Von Miller.

   Super Bowl

   But that wasn't Newton's worst performance in Levi's Stadium. That
   would be in the [75]postgame press conference.

   It was a disaster from the start, as Newton approached the podium
   sulking and trying to hide inside his hoodie. In three minutes of
   pouting and dismissing, he avoided sharing any real insight into the
   game or anything else. In doing so, he threw away everything he did on
   the field over the past four months.

   "They just played better than us. I don’t know what you want me to say,
   I’m sorry," Newton said in by far his longest of seven answers. "They
   made more plays than us and that's what it came down to. We had our
   opportunities. There was nothing special they did."

   Then Newton proceeded to offer only 18 more words, the last one being
   "No" before getting up and leaving in disgust and disinterest.

   Broncos safety T.J. Ward admitted his defense kept preying on Newton's
   frustrations during the game.

   "When things don't go his way, we see his body language, it's obvious.
   That's what we wanted to do. That was our intent to come into this game
   and get that body language going," Ward said. "We didn't want the
   happy, fun-spirited, dabbing, dancing Cam. We wanted the sulking,
   upset, talking to my linemen, my running backs, 'I don't know what's
   going on' Cam and that's what we got."

   We get it. Newton isn't used to losing. He experienced that only once
   this regular season in what turned out to be a meaningless game against
   the Falcons before facing the Broncos in the Super Bowl with everything
   on the line.

   SUPER BOWL WINNERS: [76]Where Broncos rank

   He has won a Hesiman Trophy, a national championship, three division
   titles. He has delivered in every way with his talent as a No. 1
   overall draft pick. He should expect all his winning ways to add up to
   a Super Bowl victory.

   As the confident passer and runner he is, there's a good bet he
   envisioned raising the Lombardi Trophy as early as Sunday. But he
   played a very good team, and he was left lowering his head instead.

   Tough. Deal with it better, Cam. We've loved you so much for playing
   the game like a kid and going on this amazing ride.

   But you should also know the NFL is a grown man's game. How you handle
   your most frustrating moments tells a lot more about you than rolling
   through the good times.

   There's nothing Newton needs to do with his game to go that one extra
   step. He's already transcendent there.

   But for him to get to a Super Bowl again and actually help his team win
   it, he needs more maturity. This presser will throw him back in public
   perception, back when he was the younger Newton with the towel over his
   head on the sidelines.

   IMAGES: [77]Best of Super Bowl 50

   Before his Broncos counterpart, Peyton Manning, was carried to his
   second ring on Sunday, he had lost and struggled in more Super
   Bowls than he had won. Through the early days when playoff wins weren't
   coming, Manning still carried himself with class.

   See Tom Brady, Russell Wilson, Aaron Rodgers, Drew Brees. Even when
   they go through the biggest pain of losing, they put their best face
   forward, for the sake of their teammates, and just as important, their
   fans.

   There's a lot of criticism of Newton that's unwarranted and unfair. But
   often the happiest, most jovial kid can turn into a brat when he
   doesn't get what he wants.

   Forget Newton figuring out how to help his team one more game next
   season. He has to first worry about getting over one more loss.
