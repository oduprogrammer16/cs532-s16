\begin{answer}{1}
The rss feed that was used in this assignment was obtained from Sports World News 4/12/16 at 4:15 PM EST, via the following link \url{http://www.sportsworldnews.com/rss/}. Once this feed was obtained, the 100 entries were then classified according to the following categories as seen in Table 1. 
\begin{table}[ht!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline
    \textbf{Number} & \textbf{Category}  \\\hline
    1 & Wrestling  \\\hline 
    2 & National Hockey League \\\hline 
    3 & National Football League  \\\hline 
    4 & Boxing  \\\hline 
    5 & Other   \\\hline 
    6 & MLS   \\\hline 
    7 & Major League Baseball   \\\hline 
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Categories and their description}
    \label{tab:my_label}
\end{table}
\end{answer}

\begin{answer}{2}
A program called makeTrainingData.py was created to aid in assigning each feed a category. The program reads a list of categories and the name of an rss feed link or file. It then displays the description in the entry and prompts the user for a number corresponding to a category as seen in Figure 1. Afterwards, the user is prompted for the name of a file to save the data, and the program saves the data in the format $<$guid$>$ $|$ $<$category$>$. 
\begin{figure}[ht!]

\newpage

Once all 100 entries were classified, a program called trainClassifier.py was written. This program utilizes a sqlite3 database. This database is also accessed by fisherclassifier\cite{tobysegaran2007}. First, the title, guid(link), description and actual category, are parsed and inserted into  a table called feeds which is located within the database. This table also has an integer called isTrainingData for which 0 means that is is not training data and 1 indicating that is is training data. A dictionary is also created which maps the guid to the feedelement created by the feedparser. Once the information from all 100 feed elements are extracted, and loaded into the database, a file called partialTrainingData.txt is read by the program. Each line of the file is in the format $<$guid$>|<$category$>$. The program matches the guid with the description in each feed acquired from the database and uses the description to train the fisher classifier\cite{tobysegaran2007} and updates the corresponding column isTrainingData to a 1. classifier.  The database code in the fisher classifier was rewritten to use sqlite3.  
\newpage 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,caption=Training the fisher classifier]
def train_classifier(settings,trainingData):
	
	counter = 0 # Used for status information.
	size = len(trainingData)
	database = FeedDatabase(settings['database'])
	
	# Create the classifier
	classifier = fisherclassifier(getwords)
	
	# Set the name of the database
	classifier.setdb(settings['database'])
	for key in trainingData.keys():
		sys.stderr.write('...Training ({0}/{1})...\n'.format(counter,size))
		classifier.train(trainingData[key]['description'],
		                    trainingData[key]['category'])
		counter +=1
	sys.stderr.write('...Finished Training Classifier\n')
\end{lstlisting}
After the fisher classifier is trained, a program called classifyFeed.py pulls the training data from the database. It then  pulls all the feed entries in which the value isTrainingData is equal to zero and then classify those entries based on the content in the description. After the remaining unclassified entries are classified, the guid, and predicted category are printed to the standard output. For this assignment, the standard output is piped into a file called resul2.txt. Then a script called analyzePredictions.py, pulls the actual categories for each feed from the database,compares them with the predicted categories in the file result.txt and computes the fisher probability. The title, predicted category, actual category and fisher probability are then displayed to the standard output. Table 1 shows the results from the analysis.

\caption{Predictions made from the fisher classifier} % needs to go inside longtable environment

\newpage
\begin{answer}{3}
To analyze the performance of the classifier, a script called AS9P1.py which was graciously written by Gabriel Marquez, computes the precision, recall and F-Measure of the classifier. The formula that was used in the computation of the precision for a category is based on the formulas from wikipedia and is as follows\cite{unknown}: \\ \\ $\displaystyle\text{Precision for a category} = \frac{\text{Number of correct predictions for a category}}{\text{Total Number of Predictions Made}}$ \\\\ \\
To compute the recall the following formula was used: \\\\
$\displaystyle \text{Recall for a category} = \frac{\text{Number of correct predictions for a category}}{\text{Actual Number of entries in the category}}$ \\\\\\
To compute the F-Measure for a category the following formula was used: \\ \\ 
$\displaystyle \text{F-Measure for a category} = \frac{2 \times \text{Precision for a category} \times \text{Recall for a category}}{\text{Precision for a category} + \text{Recall for a category}}$ \\\\Table 3 shows the performance values computed for each of the categories. 

\begin{table}[ht!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline
    \textbf{Category} & \textbf{Precision} & \textbf{Recall} & \textbf{F-Measure}  \\\hline
    Wrestling & 0.32 & 0.72 & 0.44 \\\hline 
    National Hockey League & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\\hline 
    National Football League & 0.1 & 0.38 & 0.15 \\\hline
    Boxing & 0.04 & 0.66 & 0.075 \\\hline

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Performance values of the Fisher Classifier}
    \label{tab:my_label}
\end{table}
\end{answer}
Based on the measures provided in table, it is concluded that the training data is skewed in wrestling had the highest precision. This could be due to the fact that most of the training data was involved Wrestling as a category. It is suggested that if this assignment were to be continued or attempted again, that a training dataset should not show as much bias towards a single category. It is also hypothesized that perhaps performing ten fold cross validation may remove some of the bias that occurred in this assignment.
