The \LaTeX code invovled in the generation of this document was aided by the example code provided in the links that Dr. Nelson sent out on January 17, 2016\cite{mohammedaturban2013}.

\begin{answer}{1}
Before starting to work on the D3 Graph, a script was written to extract the data from my twitter account. 

First a list of all of my followers was created and written to a text file called {\it kevinfollowers.txt}. This file is primarily used for backup. Then the program goes through the list of all of my followers and for each follower, checks the other followers to determine if the follower follows the other followers. The function that determines if a person follows another person is found the tweepy library\cite{joshuarosslein2009}. This code is found in Listing 1 and the final result is a csv file which describes a list of edges in the format (follower,personFollowing). In addition, this program utilizes a credential library that I developed, to  manage my twitter authorization credentials. The code for this credential library is located at my repository via the following link \url{https://github.com/oduprogrammer16/CredentialManager}.
 
 \begin{lstlisting}[langauge=Python,caption=Determining if a follower follows another follower]
 try:
	result = api.show_friendship(source_screen_name=user,target_screen_name=follower)
	
except tweepy.RateLimitError:
	printEdgeList(edgeList,'kevin_network.csv')
	printEdgeList(unknownEdges,'unknownEdges.csv')
	print("\t\tRate Limit Error Exceeded: sleeping for 15 minutes")
	time.sleep(15 * 60)
	result = api.show_friendship(source_screen_name=user,
	target_screen_name=follower)

except tweepy.TweepError as e:
	pass

if result is not None:
	if result[1].following:
		edgeList.append((follower,user))
else:
	unknownEdges.append((follower,user))
 \end{lstlisting}
\newpage 
It should be noted that this code is not effecient. A better strategy for determining who follows who in my follower list would be to get a follower's screen-name and then determine who they follow in my follower list. 

The code that was ran to extract the followers and who they follow in my follower list took exactly 4 hours, 29 minutes and thirty one seconds. This due to the fact that the twitter api only allows 180 requests every 15 minutes. \cite{twitterinc2016}

After the data was extracted, a visual graph was created using D3\cite{mikebostock2015}. The graph was created in an html file called {\it followergraph.html} and the is a modified version of Mike Bostock's basic directional force layout diagram\cite{mikebostock2016}. Figure 1 shows my network graph. This graph can also be viewed via the following url: \url{http://www.cs.odu.edu/~kclemmon/follower_graph.html}

To determine Gender Homophily, a list of followers  and their names was obtained from my twitter account using the twitter api\cite{joshuarosslein2009}. Once all the names were obtained, the genders of each follower was estimated using the the gender-detector library\cite{marcosvanetta2014}. The genders for all the followers are dumped into a json file called {\it backup2.json}. The program was able to obtain genders for 29 followers and was unable to obtain genders for 27 followers. Table 1 lists the users in which a gender was successfully estimated and Table 2 lists the users in which a gender was not successfully estimated.

Once The genders were obtained, a new csv file called {\it kevinGenderNetwork} was generated and contains a reduced number of edges. This is due to the fact that the edges who had nodes in which a gender was deemed unknown were eliminated from the graph. Figure 2 shows the network without the nodes in which a gender could not be obtained. This graph can also be viewed via the following link \url{http://www.cs.odu.edu/~kclemmon/gender_graph.html}.
\newpage 
\begin{figure}[ht!]

\end{figure}

To compute the gender homophlly of the graph, let $p$ be the ratio of male to male edges to the total number of edges, $q$ be the ratio of female to female edges to the total number of edges and $r$ represent be the ratio of cross gender edges to the total number of edges. Gender homophilly of the graph exists if $r < 2pq$\cite{michaelnelson}. 

To compute $p,q$ and $r$, A program called {\it genderHomophily.py} iterates through the edges, and computes $p,q,r$ and $2pq$ The counts are then divided by the total number of edges. \\ \\ The following results were obtained below: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $p = 0.02$ 
    \item $q = 0.71$
    \item $r = 0.26$
    \item $2pq = 0.031$
\end{itemize}
\newpage 
Since $r > 2pq$, gender homophily exists for my graph.
